      <description>Last semester I took an introductory course to information security. One of the concepts we touched on was &amp;ldquo;security by obscurity.&amp;rdquo; Basically what that means is if no one is aware of something, they can&amp;rsquo;t possibly break into it. For example, hiding your diary is a form of security by obscurity. Of course, this has it flaws. There is always the possibility that someone could somehow stumble upon your diary by accident.</description>
