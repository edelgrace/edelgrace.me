      <description>My brother got me a yarn winder for my birthday last week and yesterday I spent the afternoon winding some yarn while watching Medici: Masters of Florence on Netflix.
  Yarn that has been winded    I just finished a block week course (a week long course ) on history of early modern Europe and I was bit by the Rrenaissance bug. Historial fiction is one of my favourite genres across multiple media.</description>

      <description>Yesterday Yesterday opened up at their new location across the street. I dragged my brother along with me to the opening.
It was absolutely lovely! They had a DJ play some music in the background, a coffee bar, and a table of yummy sweets in the back. They even had door prizes, which I suspect I didn&amp;rsquo;t win anything from but that&amp;rsquo;s totally okay.
In terms of the space, it&amp;rsquo;s great!</description>

      <title>Yarn Haul #8: Gina Brown’s First Visit</title>

      <description>I went to visit another local yarn store called Gina Brown&amp;rsquo;s. I was in the area waiting to meet up with some friends and decided to pop in and check the place out. It&amp;rsquo;s way too convenient that this place is a ten minute walk away from a train station.
It&amp;rsquo;s a nice store. In the back there&amp;rsquo;s a big table available for classes and (I&amp;rsquo;m assuming) to just knit or crochet.</description>

      <description>I have been going to the Brentwood Village Mall for the past couple of years now and I have never ever noticed this nice little yarn store before until I started up crochet. The Knitting Room is a small store located in a mall close to my university. I usually go to the mall when I&amp;rsquo;m itching to walk somewhere between classes. I decided to finally visit The Knitting Room for the first time and came away with some yarn!</description>

      <title>Hooked on Crochet Spring 2017 Swap</title>

      <description>Hooked on Crochet is a Discord server that I am a part of. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what Discord is, it is essentially a chat client for gamers. You can create your own &amp;ldquo;servers&amp;rdquo; or chat rooms for dedicated topics. Hooked on Crochet is (obviously) a group of crocheters. They organized a yarn swap last spring which I took a part of.
My gifter got me a set of hand dyed Alpaca yarn, a llama stitch marker, and a pattern for a unicorn amigurumi!</description>

      <title>Crochet Haul #3: Vanna’s Choice in Silver Grey Yarn</title>

      <description>When I bought my crochet hook set, I needed to buy an additional $15 worth of products so I could get free shipping. It saved me around five dollars and there was no point in getting hooks without any yarn.
Unfortunately, they shipped it separate from the hooks but I had bought yarn from Walmart in the meantime while waiting for my things to arrive.
So here is the skein of yarn I got from Amazon.</description>
