      <description>Identify traffic with an access-list
access-list acl-name permit ip source destination dscp dscp-value Apply the access-list with the dscp value to an interfact
class-map match-all interface match ip dscp dscp-value Apply the policy
policy-map map-name class class-name [bandwidth bandwidth-value] [priority priority-level] set ip dscp dscp-value Today at work I was going over firewalls. We want to check the configuration of the firewalls and compare them to our QoS standards. I&amp;rsquo;m not too familiar with how policies and QoS are implemented on Cisco devices so it was pretty interesting to learn.</description>

      <description>The holidays are officially over, for I went back to work today. It was a bit of a slow day. I got my internship extended, however they basically treated me as a new hire since my contract ended in December. So I&amp;rsquo;m starting from scratch, essentially. I had no laptop, no e-mail, no account to login into any computer connected to the company&amp;rsquo;s network&amp;#8230; Kinda rough.
However, I did manage to do some small tasks that didn&amp;rsquo;t require the use of a computer.</description>
