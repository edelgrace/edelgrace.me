      <description>This is very long overdue but I was blog hopping and came across The Daily Prophecy ran by Mel. Her latest post was a quick survey of all the books she read in 2016. At the end of her post, she posed the question:

 This is a very tough question for me to answer. I read a couple of very good books this year.</description>
