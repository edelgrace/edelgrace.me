      <description>I have been following Justin Guitar&amp;#8216;s lesson plans for learning the guitar.
This week I went through the first 15 beginner&amp;rsquo;s course lessons, BC-101 to BC-115. I learned the basics of choosing a guitar, posture, etc. In terms of actually playing, I learned the D chord, A chord, and E chord. The first two chords were incredibly &amp;ldquo;easy.&amp;rdquo; The chord that really stumped me was the E chord. I could not press down on the strings hard enough so that it didn&amp;rsquo;t sound muted.</description>
