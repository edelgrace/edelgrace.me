      <description>In my last post I talked about making my boyfriend a scarf. I started it yesterday after showing him a couple of sample swatches. Out of all the scarves I showed him, he liked this one of a crochet Outline Ribbed Scarf. It&amp;rsquo;s a rather simple scarf which is nice because it&amp;rsquo;ll work up quickly. Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll finish the scarf by his birthday.
Here are some pictures of the test swatches I made.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s my boyfriend&amp;rsquo;s birthday coming up soon. I wanted to make him a knitted or a crocheted item because I need something to keep my hands busy. Plus aren&amp;rsquo;t handmade things the sweetest thing you could get as a present??
On some level, I know he&amp;rsquo;s a little picky about what kind of things he would like to wear. To avoid spending a ton of time working on something that he might not ever wear, I sent him a couple links to patterns of scarves and toques.</description>
