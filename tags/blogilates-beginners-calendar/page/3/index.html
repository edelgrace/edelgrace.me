<h3 id="day-18-lower-body">Day 18: Lower Body</h3>

<p>Because I had to make up day 17 today, I broke the two workouts up throughout the day. But near the end of the day, I just did the last two videos all at once. This day&rsquo;s workout is surprisingly not that bad. I didn&rsquo;t have any trouble with the moves today which was&#8230; Weird but satisfying.</p>

<h3 id="video-1-pumped-up-cardio-warmup">Video 1: Pumped Up Cardio Warmup</h3>

<p>I really like her cardio warmups! The only downside is that they are so loud! They&rsquo;re fun but I do have to make some slight modifications to be a little more quieter.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="video-2-beginner-inner-thighs">Video 2: Beginner Inner Thighs</h3>

<p>This video was a lot more easier this time! It seems like every time a video pops up again for the second or third time, it gets easier. Which is great! I must be making some sort of progress then. I still love that one girl in purple shorts who keeps smiling. She&rsquo;s so cute!</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="video-3-stretching-for-flexibility">Video 3: Stretching for Flexibility</h3>

<p>If I recall correctly, Cassey doesn&rsquo;t really name the moves in this video so I won&rsquo;t list them. They&rsquo;re all pretty basic moves which were easy to do. Except for the bridge. I was not flexible enough to do the bridge! I tried to rest my head on the floor but head just ended up hurting. Maybe next time!</p>

<h3 id="day-17-total-body">Day 17: Total Body</h3>

<p>Okay, this is the first time I have skipped a day and had to make it up. I didn&rsquo;t feel too guilty about skipping yesterday because I had spin class, which is two (maybe even three) times as long and 234204398 times harder than these workouts. I enjoy spin class though, don&rsquo;t get me wrong! It&rsquo;s the only &ldquo;real&rdquo; cardio I do, unless you count Cassey&rsquo;s occasional four minute cardio videos. Also, I brisquely walked around for an hour. I was craving food and the cheapest and least caloric food is Wendy&rsquo;s (I love their $2 small chilies) which is quite a walk away and I had to get to class on time so I sped walk there and back. So yeah, the guilt was basically non-existent. I got home, ate supper, and literally went to bed at 8 and fell asleep around 9. I was pooped for some reason!</p>

<p>Anyway, overall, this &ldquo;day&rdquo; was pretty okay. A couple of hard moves but I think I can feel myself getting stronger and being more capable of performing everything. Not to say that I don&rsquo;t occasionally pause the video anymore, but I can feel it getting easier.</p>

<h3 id="video-1-fat-burning-cardio-warmup">Video 1: Fat Burning Cardio Warmup</h3>

<p>What I like about this video is that it&rsquo;s relatively quiet. I got up at 6 this morning and did these exercises as quietly as possible and was still able to get my heart rate up and my skin sweating! Since I&rsquo;ve done this warmup before, I won&rsquo;t describe all the moves. I can&rsquo;t really pick a favourite one or a least favourite one. I guess I don&rsquo;t really understand the squat curl. Like on a philosophical level. Did that make sense?</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="video-2-5-best-exercises-to-flatten-your-lower-belly">Video 2: 5 Best Exercises to Flatten Your Lower Belly</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Best exercises,&rdquo; okay. I really need this video in my life, probably. I&rsquo;ve been trying to flatten my belly for years and ultimately, this is what my fitness kick is trying to accomplish! Also, I do not recommend abs/belly exercises right after you eat a big meal. Do not do it.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Double Leg Lift:</em> Cassey really loves her double leg lifts! I think I&rsquo;ve gotten used to them. This move can go on forever though.</li>
<li><em>Reverse Crunch:</em> Okay, this move was interesting. I did enjoy it a bit but it kind of hurt on my way down.</li>
<li><em>Heel Clicks:</em> Ridiculously simple but it gets tiring really easily! I tried my best to go as low as I could but darn, it gets harder as you get lower!</li>
<li><em>Cheerleader L&rsquo;s:</em> I hate this one! It&rsquo;s pretty hard for me to keep my balance and keep my shoulders off the mat. Not going to lie, I had to resort to the beginner&rsquo;s modification.</li>
<li><em>Rocket:</em> The rocket was also hard. This one hurt a lot. It felt like my shoulders were digging into the ground. I probably just need practice.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-3-muffin-top-massacre">Video 3: Muffin top Massacre</h3>

<p>With &ldquo;massacre&rdquo; in the title, I really was expecting worse. But I didn&rsquo;t get it! Which was surprising. For some reason I wondered why a lot of these moves were targeted to muffin tops&#8230; I don&rsquo;t even know if I have muffin tops.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Elegant Candlestick:</em> This was a pretty good move. It felt like a stretch more than anything. I really pictured the candlestick from &ldquo;Beauty and the Beast&rdquo; while doing this move.</li>
<li><em>Truck Drivers:</em> Another pretty good move! I love the truck driver analogy. It did get tiring but I didn&rsquo;t feel it as much as the other moves. The burn was less but it totally drained some of my stamina.</li>
<li><em>Caressing Side Squeezers:</em> This was hard but I mostly made it through! Lifting myself up is the hardest part about this move, which is basically what the move is. So the hardest part was the entire thing.</li>
<li><em>Obliquatories and Flexed Obliquatories:</em> Keeping my lower leg lifted proved to be a challenge so I just kept it on the floor for most of the move. My legs definitely hurt more than whatever this move was supposed to work. Also, I&rsquo;m not sure if the name of the move is a pun or not but I approve.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="day-16-abs">Day 16: Abs</h3>

<p>Okay, this is the first day that I technically did not do on the right day. I started this one a little after midnight because I was working on an assignment and then I looked at the time&#8230; Whoops, the day went by fast! Today&rsquo;s videos were okay. The first video was mostly good but the second video was killer. My neck hurts more than it should.</p>

<h3 id="video-1-total-body-workout">Video 1: Total Body Workout</h3>

<p>Not much to say about this video except for the fact that those hundreds still get me. I&rsquo;ve been looking at comments and I&rsquo;m not the only one with the same problem. I wish there was a way to fix it though!</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="video-2-5-best-and-most-effective-ab-exercises">Video 2: 5 Best and Most Effective Ab Exercises</h3>

<p>I hate ab videos so much&#8230; So many of them require lifting my shoulders off the ground and it hurts my neck! I really don&rsquo;t know how to do this entire video properly.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Saturn Rings:</em> This is a really creative move. I just wish I could do them properly. The theme of this video is &ldquo;ow my neck omg HOW DO YOU DO THAT???&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t have anything small and heavy with me so I just used my 3DS. I probably might have as well not used a weight at all, haha.</li>
<li><em>Weighted Roll Up:</em> I didn&rsquo;t have enough room to stretch my arm to the side so I just lifted it slightly lower than my other arm holding the &ldquo;weight.&rdquo; These were hard but definitely the easiest move in the video. I got tired which is weird for roll ups!</li>
<li><em>Double Leg Lift:</em> These ones are okay, maybe even easier than the weighted roll up. I&rsquo;m also doubting whether or not I&rsquo;m doing this move correctly though. I feel it more in my legs than in my abs.</li>
<li><em>Criss Cross:</em> I hate these!!! My neck seriously hurts doing these. But halfway through the move Cassey mentioned you didn&rsquo;t have to touch your knees to your elbows and that made it somewhat easier for me after making that adjustment.</li>
<li><em>Hollow Rock:</em> How??? I don&rsquo;t know how to do this move at all! When I get up and I go back down on the floor, my shoulder blades thump hard onto the floor and it hurts. I really don&rsquo;t know how Cassey does it&#8230;</li>

<h3 id="day-15-total-body">Day 15: Total Body</h3>

<p>My body issues seem to have improved, minus the random headaches. I tried my best to stay active and not give into my pain. I might have to go to the doctor tomorrow though, if it gets any worse. Both videos today contained moves that were not named so I&rsquo;m not going to bother with going through each move.</p>

<h3 id="video-1-5-minute-ab-express">Video 1: 5 Minute Ab Express</h3>

<p>5 minutes of torture&#8230; Kidding, sort of. I was able to do the majority of the moves in this video. I still struggle with Pilates stance. I know what I should be doing but the execution part, not so much. There was only one move that I really had trouble with.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="video-2-feel-good-soul-stretches">Video 2: Feel Good Soul Stretches</h3>

<p>A lot of lunges in this stretching video. Not a fan of lunges. Also I have very bad balance. That isn&rsquo;t a new development but I just wanted to confirm that nothing has changed, yet.</p>

<p>Ummm, what?? It&rsquo;s rest day already?? I do not believe it. I&rsquo;ve been at this for two weeks now! I feel proud of myself, I never thought I would be able to make it this far. I&rsquo;m officially halfway through the calendar! I decided not to do a workout video today because I&rsquo;ve been so tired and lethargic lately and all of my limbs feel sore. I know this sounds like an excuse but at the moment, I&rsquo;m feeling pretty scared about my health. Recently I started taking a medication and the side effects have been less than stellar. I&rsquo;m trying not to feel too bad about it though because today is &ldquo;rest day&rdquo; after all.</p>

<p>I never actually try these recipes but they are pretty intriguing&#8230; I think I might try this tomorrow morning.</p>
