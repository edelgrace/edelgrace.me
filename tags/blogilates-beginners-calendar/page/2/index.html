<h3 id="day-23-abs">Day 23: Abs</h3>

<p>Okay I&rsquo;m pretty behind. It&rsquo;s now past midnight, I should be doing day 25 today. I&rsquo;m waking up early tomorrow so I&rsquo;ll have to skip out on catching up on day 24 until later in the day. Yesterday (two days ago?) I came home late with a huge head ache and immediately fell asleep. Like I came home, fell on my bed, and went to sleep! My headache was brutal.</p>

<h3 id="video-1-total-body-workout">Video 1: Total Body Workout</h3>

<p>These are getting easier with every video! Except for those hundreds. I still can&rsquo;t do them without pausing. One day I will get there (I say that every time). The leg moves were a little bit tougher today (just by a smidgen) since I had my cycling class today.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="video-2-6-minutes-to-a-sexy-little-waist">Video 2: 6 Minutes to a Sexy Little Waist</h3>

<p>This video wasn&rsquo;t that bad.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Rainbow Oblique:</em> A really interesting move. I felt like I over compensated with this move because I only felt it in my legs and not in my obliques. Also, Cassey looks so graceful doing this move but I&rsquo;m sure I looked like a mess doing it!</li>
<li><em>Windshield Wipers:</em> Another one that I felt I wasn&rsquo;t doing properly. But I did feel a burn, just not in the side. My legs totally felt this one.</li>
<li><em>Waist Whittlers:</em> I find these really hard! I could not do these with the modification. And it took a while to actually get it properly. These killed me!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-3-quick-ab-workout">Video 3: Quick Ab Workout</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Quick.&rdquo; It felt like eternity! I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of long repetitions, I really like it when there&rsquo;s variety in the moves. This video is essentially two move: double leg lift and criss cross. The double leg lift was hard and I could not do it without the beginner&rsquo;s modification. My back keeps wanting to arch and create that hollow. When I tried to flatten my back out, I definitely felt my abs. Which is what was supposed to happen! As for the criss cross, I could only do four without feeling pain already. I had to pause a couple of times but strangely, I found these easier to do.</p>

<h3 id="day-22-total-body">Day 22: Total Body</h3>

<p>I was so close to not doing today&rsquo;s workout because I came home late from a volunteering gig with a raging head ache. I slept for about four hours and woke up around 10:30. It took me a while to get started with the workout, I didn&rsquo;t start until 11:15 and I finished at 11:55! Overall, today was pretty hard but the moves are all relatively simple. It&rsquo;s the repetition and longevity that makes it hard.</p>

<h3 id="video-1-the-ultimate-hot-body-workout">Video 1: The Ultimate Hot Body Workout</h3>

<p>The video titles for today make me feel a little bit vain&#8230; I&rsquo;m not really doing these exercises for what the title says but just to get more fit! Although, I really am aiming for the flat stomach&#8230; So I&rsquo;m not totally 100% vain free.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Eagle:</em> It took me a while to finish this move because I kept pausing. I really felt this one in my abs. It&rsquo;s probably the hardest move out of the three videos.</li>
<li><em>Bridge Pulses:</em> A relatively easy move. Near the end I was really feeling my hamstrings. Remember to clench your butt or you will not feel anything!</li>
<li><em>Criss Cross/Scissors:</em> Cassey doesn&rsquo;t really name this move so I&rsquo;m not sure this is the correct name for it. This is a really boring move to do for more than a minute. The legs were definitely hurting a bit.</li>
<li><em>Half Cobra Pushup:</em> I almost did these nonstop, almost. My heart was pumping with this move! My cardio for the day? This was really hard to do over and over again. My arms were burning with this move!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-2-5-best-butt-exercises-to-sculpt-a-cute-booty">Video 2: 5 Best Butt Exercises to Sculpt a Cute Booty</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if these exercises really &ldquo;lift&rdquo; the butt like Cassey says. Do I even want a lifted, firmer butt? Is that a thing to be desired? Well, my butt is pretty flat&#8230; Anyway, the moves are also easy in this video. I didn&rsquo;t have as much trouble with this video compared to the first one.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Bridge Pulses (Again):</em> I actually like this move. It&rsquo;s simple but it burns at the same time. I like the little variations Cassey does to keep it from being too monotonous.</li>
<li><em>Grasshopper:</em> This hurt! But I did it. I&rsquo;m not sure if I felt more successful with the grasshopper compared to the last time I did these. The last five countdown was a struggle but I chased after it!</li>
<li><em>Heel Kicks:</em> So I lost my balance with this move a couple of times, haha. I liked this move though. I could feel myself kicking lower and lower with each kick so I really had to be conscious of that.</li>

<li><p><em>Rainbow Butt:</em> I did not feel this move that much. It could be because I didn&rsquo;t have enough space to do it and couldn&rsquo;t go to my potential? I&rsquo;m not sure. But this was another move that I lost my balance with. Maybe I&rsquo;ll try it later to really feel the burn.</p>

<h3 id="video-3-how-to-do-the-splits">Video 3: How To do the Splits</h3></li>
</ul>

<p>Cassey has courage doing these videos in front of the London bridge (I wasn&rsquo;t really listening so I wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was the London bridge or if there really is a London bridge). Cassey doesn&rsquo;t really name her move in this videos so I&rsquo;ll just talk about it generally. These are pretty good post-workout stretches even if doing the splits aren&rsquo;t a goal of mine.</p>

<p>Today was a much needed rest day. Lately I&rsquo;ve been having the tendency to fall asleep as soon as I get home, which sucks. So I decided to just sleep, haha! I didn&rsquo;t try out the pizza. Maybe one day. Seriously, one day I will try all of her recipes!</p>

<h3 id="day-19-total-body">Day 19: Total Body</h3>

<p>I got home today after writing a midterm and I was so tired that I was tempted to just not do the workout today but then I realized tomorrow os rest day and who wants to work out on rest day? Not me. So I decided against it and got off my butt to do it. And I&rsquo;m glad I did because today was so much easier!</p>

<h3 id="video-1-butt-lift-and-slim-thighs">Video 1: Butt Lift and Slim Thighs</h3>

<p>I did this workout yesterday because I was bored and yay I get to do it again! This is a very easy video but the burn is definitely there.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Straight Leg Pulse:</em> By far the easiest move. Cassey doesn&rsquo;t keep you going long enough for it to hurt.</li>
<li><em>Fire Hydrant and Fire Hydrant Kick:</em> These definitely got tiresome especially when the kick was added but the burn felt amazing.</li>
<li><em>Sexy Dancer Kicks:</em> A very simple move. You really have to focus on tending your legs and moving slowly and deliberately to feel something.</li>
<li><em>Hot Potato:</em> Another easy move to do and to feel the burn. I struggled with the pacing a bit because I didn&rsquo;t want to tap on the floor too loud and wake my parents up.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-2-fat-destroyer">Video 2: Fat Destroyer</h3>

<p>My heart was really pumping for this video! At the risk of repeating myself, this is hard to do quietly.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Squat Tap:</em> I didn&rsquo;t do the jump associated with this but I did make sure to squat as low as possible.</li>
<li><em>Lunge to High Kick:</em> I lost my balance easily with this one, haha!</li>
<li><em>Plank Walk Opener:</em> A fun move that kind of slowed down the pace but not too much.</li>
<li><em>Plank Jack:</em> Had to substitute this one with a quieter version but even that was difficult.</li>
<li><em>Mountain Climber and Wide Mountain Climber:</em> The wide climber was LOUD but I managed to do the normal version well.</li>
<li><em>Pile Hops:</em> Another one I couldn&rsquo;t do with the jump, I just focused on squatting as low as possible.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-3-upper-back-and-leg-stretches">Video 3: Upper Back and Leg Stretches</h3>

<p>Really great stretches for the legs, my problem area. It requires the usage of a belt or a long strap. You really get a stretch out of this one!</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Hundred:</em> I hate the hundred. So much! But today I was able to do it from start to finish, I think. Or at least, mostly from start to finish. I hated every second of it though.</li>
<li><em>Double Leg Stretch:</em> This was kind of a fun move if it didn&rsquo;t hurt my neck so much. My neck always hurts whenever we do these ab exercises&#8230; Ugh!</li>
<li><em>Barbie Feet:</em> I felt a little cute doing this move, haha! But don&rsquo;t let the cuteness fool you, it&rsquo;s a bit hard. My legs were definitely getting tired.</li>
<li><em>Reverse Crunch:</em> These got my heart pumping! I liked doing these a lot AND I could feel the burn. My butt kind of hurt afterwards though.</li>
<li><em>1-2-3 Crunch:</em> Another hard move&#8230; The crunch is what got me. I have enough trouble doing it without the crunch!</li>
<li><em>Heel Clicks:</em> In hindsight, this is a really easy move but doing it back to back with other moves where I have to lift my shoulders makes it harder than usual!</li>
<li><em>See Saw Abs:</em> I. Could. Not. Do. These! Not to save my life. So I just opted for reverse crunches during this move.</li>
<li><em>Helicopters:</em> A really nice and easy move! It&rsquo;s fun watching Cassey do it. Not as fun actually doing it but there&rsquo;s still some fun in it.</li>
<li><em>Corkscrew:</em> I had a lot of trouble doing these with straight legs but I managed to kind of do them with bent legs. My butt hurt.</li>
<li><em>Single Leg Drop:</em> A nice easy way to end the video. And it seemed like it lasted for only a couple of seconds!</li>
</ul>

<p>This video is essentially two moves so I won&rsquo;t bother listing them. The moves were hard! I kept hearing clicking and cracking noises and it kind of worried me a bit. Still, this was really hard! I had to pause the video a couple of time to catch a breather.</p>
