<h3 id="day-3-total-body">Day 3: Total Body</h3>

<p>Today&rsquo;s workout starts off with 10 burpees. I will admit, I haven&rsquo;t done burpees since junior high school and I totally forgot how to do them. Unlike yesterday with the sit-ups, I didn&rsquo;t know how to do them at all. Like I had no notion of what a burpee was. So I had to look it up. Once I read the description, my junior high school gym classes suddenly came flooding back to me. I hated burpees back then and I still do now. In the end I opted for Fitness Blender&rsquo;s silent burpees because I&rsquo;m on the second floor and my parents were sleeping in the basement. Also it was almost midnight.</p>

<h3 id="video-1-bubble-butt-workout">Video 1: Bubble Butt Workout</h3>

<p>This video is around 9 minutes long and surprisingly only has three moves. There are a little more reps for each workout though, and that&rsquo;s for each leg.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Toe to ceiling pulse:</em> At first this started out easy but it got a little tiring near the end. I made it though!</li>
<li><em>Hammy curl:</em> This one I felt like I was on the verge of cramping up so I admit I did not clench as hard as I should have.</li>
<li><em>Grashopper:</em> I could not do these at all! It felt like I was doing them but my legs probably lifted maybe half a centimeter off the floor.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-2-total-body-workout-with-ana-caban">Video 2: Total Body Workout with Ana Caban</h3>

<p>In this video, Cassey brings on a guest Pilates instructor, Ana Caban. I&rsquo;m guessing Ana is big in the pilates world because Cassey was fangirling over her a bit. It was kind of cute to see! There isn&rsquo;t a big difference between Cassey and Ana other than Cassey is more talkative. Their moves are approximately around the same level.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Roll up:</em> I&rsquo;ve come to like roll ups a lot. Maybe it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s the only move I can do!</li>
<li><em>1 Legged Teaser Twist:</em> I just did these and I don&rsquo;t remember what they were&#8230; I had to rewatch the beginning of the video, haha. This move looks so graceful! I think this is one of the easier moves in this video.</li>
<li><em>Kneeling Side Series:</em> This is very similar to one of the moves from yesterday, I think (I don&rsquo;t remember which one exactly). It&rsquo;s not hard, it&rsquo;s just hard to resist giving up, haha! My legs tend to get tired easily doing moves like these.</li>
<li><em>Half Cobra Pushup:</em> Cassey herself said these were pretty simple but doing a lot of them in a row gets tough. Unfortunately, Casey doesn&rsquo;t exactly let it get to that point in the video.</li>
<li><em>Banana and Banana Teaser Twist:</em> It was really hard keeping my balance for these moves and because of that, I wasn&rsquo;t doing them properly. I felt zero tension in my body doing these.</li>
<li><em>Double Leg Lift:</em> This one was actually an okay move! When it comes to the pilates stance, my neck tends to hurt a lot. It&rsquo;s most likely because I&rsquo;m not doing it right and lifting with my neck and not my abs but I&rsquo;m not sure how to do that exactly.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>What I did differently today was watch the videos once or twice before actually starting the workout. I had to be somewhere really early in the morning and I didn&rsquo;t have time to do the workout then so I just downloaded the videos and watched them on my commute. When I got home later that evening, I made up the skeleton of this post, as I noted all the different exercises before hand. This was my second exposure to the workout. I splurged on food today so I didn&rsquo;t actually get to working out until late night since my stomach was so full for what felt like hours (I almost ate one pound of calories today, r.i.p. me).</p>

<p>This day I think was purposefully easier. Probably because Cassey (accurately) anticipated how sore my abs were from yesterday! It was a good boost in motivation.</p>

<p>The only downside is that I should not have had a glass of water literally minutes before starting this. My stomach felt full and uncomfortable throughout the whole thing but I wanted to get it done before midnight. Never again.</p>

<h3 id="day-2-abs">Day 2: Abs</h3>

<p>Today&rsquo;s workout is split into two videos. Both target your abs however they vary in difficulty. It&rsquo;s worth noting that spot reduction (focusing on working out a specific part of your body to lose fat in that one specific area) is a myth. It&rsquo;s only when your overall body fat percentage lowers that will you see results and they will be present around your whole body and not in just one area. What targeting certain areas does do is help strengthen them but fat will not necessarily be lost there specifically.</p>

<p>Anyway, the day starts off with 10 sit-ups. I have an embarrassing confession to make. I have completely forgotten how to do a sit-up! Well, I remember how it should be done, but I cannot actually do it anymore. The last time I did a sit-up was in middle school. That was nearly six years ago&#8230; Maybe it&rsquo;s because whenever we did sit-ups, we were anchored by someone holding our feet. Even then, I remember it being so hard. So instead, I did a couple of roll-ups because I can somewhat do those.</p>

<h3 id="video-1-ab-time">Video 1: Ab Time!</h3>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<p>Onto the first real workout. The first video is considerably &ldquo;easy&rdquo; (at least, compared to the second one). Cassey goes through the following exercises:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Roll ups:</em> I warmed up with the roll ups but I didn&rsquo;t mind doing it yet again.</li>
<li><em>The corkscrew:</em> It&rsquo;s weird because I had a lot of trouble keeping my balance with this one. I found my hips shifting all over the place. It didn&rsquo;t get tiring but it was just plain hard to do.</li>
<li><em>Oblique dippers:</em> These are like side push-ups on one hand. They feel deceivingly easy because it&rsquo;s surprisingly easy to do wrong. Cassey gives tips on how to make it harder or easier for you, depending on how you feel.</li>
<li><em>Planks:</em> The dreaded plank&#8230; I have zero strength so this was hard. Casey goes through different variations of planking.</li>
<li><em>Elbow to knee plank:</em> I&rsquo;ve actually done this exercise before, when I used to do Fitness Blender videos! For some reason, it felt especially tougher to them this time around. But I actually enjoy this move. If only I had more room in my bedroom to do it! I had move a couple of furniture around.</li>
<li><em>Knee to chest plank:</em> This is another move that I&rsquo;m familiar with, due to Fitness Blender. I never liked these and I still don&rsquo;t like them.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-2-10-minute-ab-sculpting-workout">Video 2: 10 Minute Ab Sculpting Workout</h3>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<p>The second video is &ldquo;just&rdquo; 10 minutes of ab sculpting. I found it extremely hard! At the beginning of the video, Cassey even warns you about the incoming suffering and torture she is about to put you through. Great&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Genie twist:</em> This hurt my shoulders because I kept hitting my floor hard. I also felt a little bit silly because it felt like I was just flailing on the floor, haha.</li>
<li><em>Butterfly crunch:</em> I was able to do this one, although I was a lot slower than Cassey in doing it but at least I could do it properly.</li>
<li><em>Crunch cross, straight leg crunch cross, and advanced straight crunch cross:</em> Okay. While doing these, I had to pause the video and lay on my floor for a minute or two to contemplate my life. I&rsquo;m not even exaggerating. These were the hardest moves in the entire workout for me. My neck hurt a lot doing just two in a row. Probably a sign that I was doing it wrong but still. It&rsquo;s a struggle for me to keep my shoulders off the floor. Honestly, I did just the regular crunch cross and some of the straight leg crunch cross because the more advance variations were too much for me.</li>
<li><em>V sit-up:</em> These were hard since I can&rsquo;t even do a regular sit-up but I attempted these as much as I could. I actually felt like I was more capable of doing these over the regular sit-ups except I knew I didn&rsquo;t have the exact &ldquo;V&rdquo; shape that Cassey had.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>If you think I complained a lot, you&rsquo;re right. As someone who doesn&rsquo;t do much physical activity, I struggled A LOT. I don&rsquo;t like exercise but it seems to be a necessary evil. This is a journey and hopefully it will get easier as time goes one. Maybe I just need to push myself harder. So if you can&rsquo;t take my complaining, feel free to avoid reading my fitness posts.</p>

<p>Today was so much harder than yesterday. There were a few easier moves in this day but overall, it was hard! I swore a lot under my breath. It felt like I worked harder but not necessarily better. Tomorrow I think I will put more effort on doing the workout accurately. My downside is that I tried to figure out the moves as Cassey went through the workout. So by the time I had some semblance of what to do, she moves onto the next move. Next time I&rsquo;ll pause the video and resume it when I feel ready to do so.</p>

<p>I also watch the videos on my phone and it&rsquo;s kind of hard trying to do the exercise and watch what&rsquo;s happening. Maybe I should watch them on my laptop? I could technically watch them on the TV as well but I&rsquo;d rather have the privacy of my own room while I&rsquo;m doing exercise. I think I must look silly, especially when I&rsquo;m not doing the workouts properly!</p>

<p>So today was a tough day. Tomorrow will be equally or even more harder but I&rsquo;ll just brace myself as much as possible.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This &ldquo;review&rdquo;/blog series is NOT sponsored in any way and all opinions are entirely of my own.</p>

<p>My first post of 2016! This year I resolved to get healthier. That is, eat healthier and be more active! I&rsquo;ve been hanging out on the <a href="http://reddit.com/r/xxfitness">/r/xxfitness: Fitness for Women</a> subreddit a lot lately. Since I&rsquo;m hesitant to go to the gym, someone suggested I try <a href="http://blogilates.com">Blogilates</a>, ran by Cassey Ho. I browsed the site a bit and decided to try the <a href="http://www.blogilates.com/blog/2014/12/30/new-beginners-calendar-2-0-for-2015/">Beginner&rsquo;s Workout Calendar</a> which lasts for four weeks.</p>

<h3 id="quick-facts-about-blogilates">Quick facts about Blogilates</h3>

<ul>
<li>The majority of the content is free. Most of Cassey&rsquo;s videos are up on YouTube.</li>
<li>Subscribing to her newsletter gives you access to unique monthly workout plans.</li>
<li>There is an app, however you have to pay for her calendars but her recipes and videos are all free.</li>
<li>As far as I know, pilates is all bodyweight exercises so absolutely no equipment is needed for her videos.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://scattered.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/blogilates-beginners-calender-2.png" rel="attachment wp-att-11076"><img src="http://scattered.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/blogilates-beginners-calender-2-1024x806.png" alt="blogilates-beginners-calender-2" width="1024" height="806" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11076" srcset="http://erzadel.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/blogilates-beginners-calender-2-1024x806.png 1024w, http://erzadel.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/blogilates-beginners-calender-2-300x236.png 300w, http://erzadel.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/blogilates-beginners-calender-2-768x604.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>

<h3 id="day-1-total-body-workout">Day 1: Total Body Workout</h3>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<p>Cassey starts off the video with some breathing techniques, for the absolute beginners to pilates (AKA me). She then goes into the following exercises:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Pilates stance:</em> This is one of the easier ones although my neck kinda hurt a little.</li>
<li><em>Roll ups:</em> Apparently one roll up is equivalent to six crunches and Cassey makes you do around four of these. I struggled with doing this properly as I really do not have the strength to lift myself up from a lying position without any support. I found this one kind of fun though.</li>
<li><em>Leg stuff:</em> Okay, this part was grueling! I have a tendency to painfully cramp in my legs, so I admit I did this section half-heartedly because it felt like I was constantly on the cusp of cramping up. Maybe that&rsquo;s just the nature of the workout but hopefully it improves soon. However, some of the moves are really graceful in this one and I really admired how pretty it looked (when Cassey did it).</li>
<li><em>Cobra position:</em> These moves were like something I&rsquo;d expect from yoga.</li>
<li><em>Elbow push ups:</em> I hate push ups with a dying passion but these were not that bad. Granted, I did do the knee variant. My knees also hurt afterward.</li>
<li><em>Mermaid stretches:</em> These are rather interesting. Although, I feel like I did them wrong because I didn&rsquo;t feel a lot of stretching going on.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>Man, I&rsquo;m out of shape. I didn&rsquo;t do a lot of these exercises 100% as I&rsquo;m not used to physical activity like this. However, Cassey can be really encouraging and she does offer tips on how to ease up on the difficulty if you&rsquo;re having trouble.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen some people complain about Cassey&rsquo;s perkiness but I have nothing to complain about, yet. Sometimes I felt like dying and Cassey would say something like, &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t nothing yet!&rdquo; and I found it kind of motivating. But we&rsquo;ll see as time goes on. I did like how Cassey would tell stories, as it (kind of) takes your mind off the fact that you feel like you&rsquo;re dying.</p>

<p>Overall, I feel sore all over but I feel really happy to have day one over and done with! Starting is always the hardest part so just getting through the first little bit is always a struggle. I&rsquo;ve read that it only gets harder from here on in but I&rsquo;m hoping that I&rsquo;ll be able to stick through with it all.</p>
