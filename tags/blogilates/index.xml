Day 28: Rest Day Oh my goodness, today is the last day of the fitness calendar! I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I made it! I didn&amp;rsquo;t make this cookie (I haven&amp;rsquo;t made any of the rest day recipes) but like with the rest of the recipes, I would love to try this eventually!</description>

Day 27: Total Body Today is the last day of the beginner&amp;rsquo;s workout calendar, not including the rest day tomorrow! I think I&amp;rsquo;ll make a blog post the day after rest day to talk about how the month went. As for today, today was a lot of sweat and groaning! A lot of cardio today, even if it isn&amp;rsquo;t intensive.</description>

Day 26: Abs Video 1: Train Insane HIIT Workout  Video 2: Muffintop Shredder Workout I can&amp;rsquo;t remember anymore but I think I&amp;rsquo;ve done this video before. This video is really simple, there is just one move: the candlestick. I think I was doing it properly this time because I started to get tired and I could feel burning in my limbs and my core (I can&amp;rsquo;t be as technical as Cassey, what are my obliques?</description>

Day 25: Lower Body Video 1: Far Burning Cardio Warmup I&amp;rsquo;ve done this video so many times that I&amp;rsquo;ve almost memorized everything Cassey said, haha! The moves in this video are easy and fun, as always.
 Video 2: Hips Butt &amp;#8216;n Thighs Super Shaper Workout   Hot Potato: This is a nice and easy move to start off the video.</description>

Day 24: Lower Body I&amp;rsquo;m still behind&amp;#8230; Oh well, I mostly caught up today. I still have one video to do for day 25 but it&amp;rsquo;s day 25 now and I have three hours left to do it! Today was pretty hard but that could be due to the fact I did two days in one.</description>

Day 23: Abs Okay I&amp;rsquo;m pretty behind. It&amp;rsquo;s now past midnight, I should be doing day 25 today. I&amp;rsquo;m waking up early tomorrow so I&amp;rsquo;ll have to skip out on catching up on day 24 until later in the day. Yesterday (two days ago?) I came home late with a huge head ache and immediately fell asleep.</description>

Day 22: Total Body I was so close to not doing today&amp;rsquo;s workout because I came home late from a volunteering gig with a raging head ache. I slept for about four hours and woke up around 10:30. It took me a while to get started with the workout, I didn&amp;rsquo;t start until 11:15 and I finished at 11:55!</description>

Day 21: Rest Day Today was a much needed rest day. Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been having the tendency to fall asleep as soon as I get home, which sucks. So I decided to just sleep, haha! I didn&amp;rsquo;t try out the pizza. Maybe one day. Seriously, one day I will try all of her recipes!</description>

Day 19: Total Body I got home today after writing a midterm and I was so tired that I was tempted to just not do the workout today but then I realized tomorrow os rest day and who wants to work out on rest day? Not me. So I decided against it and got off my butt to do it.</description>

Day 19: Abs I loathe ab days. They&amp;rsquo;re really hard and not that fun, haha. But I really do feel the burn the most on these days. I need to work on this&amp;#8230;
Video 1: Fun Indoor Cardio Workout There are A LOT of kicks in this video. I did my workout in the morning today so I had to do some modifications, as always.</description>

Day 18: Lower Body Because I had to make up day 17 today, I broke the two workouts up throughout the day. But near the end of the day, I just did the last two videos all at once. This day&amp;rsquo;s workout is surprisingly not that bad. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any trouble with the moves today which was&amp;#8230; Weird but satisfying.</description>

Day 17: Total Body Okay, this is the first time I have skipped a day and had to make it up. I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel too guilty about skipping yesterday because I had spin class, which is two (maybe even three) times as long and 234204398 times harder than these workouts. I enjoy spin class though, don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong!</description>

Day 16: Abs Okay, this is the first day that I technically did not do on the right day. I started this one a little after midnight because I was working on an assignment and then I looked at the time&amp;#8230; Whoops, the day went by fast! Today&amp;rsquo;s videos were okay.</description>

Day 15: Total Body My body issues seem to have improved, minus the random headaches. I tried my best to stay active and not give into my pain. I might have to go to the doctor tomorrow though, if it gets any worse. Both videos today contained moves that were not named so I&amp;rsquo;m not going to bother with going through each move.</description>

Day 14: Rest Day Ummm, what?? It&amp;rsquo;s rest day already?? I do not believe it. I&amp;rsquo;ve been at this for two weeks now! I feel proud of myself, I never thought I would be able to make it this far. I&amp;rsquo;m officially halfway through the calendar! I decided not to do a workout video today because I&amp;rsquo;ve been so tired and lethargic lately and all of my limbs feel sore.</description>

Day 13: Total Body Video 1: 5 Minute Fat Burner &amp;ldquo;Five minutes? Easy peasey.&amp;rdquo; I was so wrong! Cassey wasn&amp;rsquo;t lying when she said it would be tough. This was a hard video, with lots of suffering included (guaranteed).
  Star Jump: These were really hard to do quietly. I definitely started sweating immediately with this move.</description>

Day 12: Abs Ab workouts are so brutal&amp;#8230; And, of course, that&amp;rsquo;s what everyone wants to workout. Cue the suffering.
Video 1: Ab &amp;amp; Butt Workout I seriously cannot get over how cute Rosanna is! She is absolutely adorable and when she struggles, I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m not alone in ab hell.</description>

Day 11: Lower Body Another day, another week almost finished (I&amp;rsquo;m talking in terms of the weekday week and not the Blogilates week)! I keep mixing up the &amp;ldquo;Wake up and &amp;#8230;&amp;rdquo; preambles at the start of each day&amp;#8230;. Yesterday I did 30 second planks on each side instead of just 1 minute of planking.</description>

Day 10: Abs The day starts off with two thirty second planks on each side. How I hate planks&amp;#8230; But I did it anyway, even if I cheated for a couple seconds on each. There&amp;rsquo;s only one new video today and I decided that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t list all the moves for the other videos again in the interest of time and because I don&amp;rsquo;t really have anything to say about specific moves.</description>

Day 9: Abs Video 1: Total Body Workout I&amp;rsquo;m not going to list the moves for this video again because my comments are mostly the same from the last time I did this video. I really am progressing with those pull ups. Not once did I have to grab my legs!</description>

Day 8: Total Body After my &amp;ldquo;rest day&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ve been missing Cassey a little. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe that it&amp;rsquo;s already the second week! It doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like it&amp;rsquo;s been that long&amp;#8230;
Video 1: Indoor Cardio Workout I wish I had more time to do workouts in the morning because when it comes to the cardio videos, I just can&amp;rsquo;t do them 100% without making a bunch of noise.</description>

Day 7: Rest Day Thank goodness for the rest day. Technically there is 30 minutes left of day 7 and I feel like I should be doing something. So I&amp;rsquo;m searching for some quick videos to do before midnight hits. I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I&amp;rsquo;ve done a week of this already! Here&amp;rsquo;s to four more weeks!</description>

Day 6: Total Body &amp;ldquo;Wake up and do 15 crunches.&amp;rdquo; I did four roll ups instead. And I never do these when I wake up, usually it&amp;rsquo;s the last thing I do before bed. Not today though!
Video 1: Cardio Warmup I&amp;rsquo;m really glad Cassey puts some cardio videos because most of her workouts are focusing on toning and my main goal is to burn fat and not really &amp;ldquo;bulk&amp;rdquo; up.</description>

Day 5: Abs Okay I switched up the preambles in the calendar because apparently I can&amp;rsquo;t read. Day three I was supposed to plank for 30 seconds, yesterday I was supposed to do the burpees, and today I was supposed to drink an 8 oz of water. Whoops! So I compensated today by not only drinking the water but also doing the plank.</description>

Day 4: Lower Body The little preamble for today in the calendar simply said to drink a glass of 8 oz of water. I have no idea what 8 oz looks like. Or how much any other measurements of liquids look like for that matter. So I just drank a regular glass of water.</description>

Day 3: Total Body Today&amp;rsquo;s workout starts off with 10 burpees. I will admit, I haven&amp;rsquo;t done burpees since junior high school and I totally forgot how to do them. Unlike yesterday with the sit-ups, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to do them at all. Like I had no notion of what a burpee was.</description>

Day 2: Abs Today&amp;rsquo;s workout is split into two videos. Both target your abs however they vary in difficulty. It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that spot reduction (focusing on working out a specific part of your body to lose fat in that one specific area) is a myth. It&amp;rsquo;s only when your overall body fat percentage lowers that will you see results and they will be present around your whole body and not in just one area.</description>

My first post of 2016! This year I resolved to get healthier. That is, eat healthier and be more active! I&amp;rsquo;ve been hanging out on the /r/xxfitness: Fitness for Women subreddit a lot lately. Since I&amp;rsquo;m hesitant to go to the gym, someone suggested I try Blogilates, ran by Cassey Ho. I browsed the site a bit and decided to try the Beginner&amp;rsquo;s Workout Calendar which lasts for four weeks.</description>
