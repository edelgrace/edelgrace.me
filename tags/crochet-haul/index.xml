      <description>I decided to make a baby blanket for my cousin who is due in June. I bought a ton of Bernat Blanket skeins for this project. There is a big sale going on at Michael&amp;rsquo;s so I kept getting discount after discount. Which is good because I could never imagine buying this many skeins of Bernat Blanket at full price. I may have actually bought too many. I did buy one skein at Walmart though.</description>

      <description>I recently found out that there was a Michael&amp;rsquo;s near my workplace. Rookie mistake. After work, I walked over to the store. It&amp;rsquo;s a 20 minute walk in an area with absolutely no sidewalks. The snow hindered me a little bit but not enough to make me turn away!
Okay, this is actually my second Michael&amp;rsquo;s yarn trip but the first time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t buy a single thing. I just went to check out the place and see the different kinds of brands they had.</description>

      <description>I made a post about participating in Crochet Along Together (CAT) to make a three colour cowl and the yarn I ordered for the project finally arrived! It was good timing too because the event started the next day. I was getting a little worried that it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t arrive in time.
Despite the discount I got on the yarn due specifically to the CAT (the CAT was sponsored by this brand, I think), it was kind of pricey for me.</description>

      <title>Crochet Haul #3: Vanna’s Choice in Silver Grey Yarn</title>

      <description>When I bought my crochet hook set, I needed to buy an additional $15 worth of products so I could get free shipping. It saved me around five dollars and there was no point in getting hooks without any yarn.
Unfortunately, they shipped it separate from the hooks but I had bought yarn from Walmart in the meantime while waiting for my things to arrive.
So here is the skein of yarn I got from Amazon.</description>

      <title>Crochet Haul #2: Cheap Crochet Set</title>

      <description>Since I&amp;rsquo;m just starting out with crocheting, I bought a somewhat cheap crochet set on Amazon. I&amp;rsquo;m hesitant to buy high end luxury tools if I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure I want to continue crocheting. I do think it would be a worthy hobby to take part in!
The case itself is seriously cute. The brand seems to be Merrywindix but I can&amp;rsquo;t quite tell. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot smaller than I expected which is great, that means it&amp;rsquo;s extremely portable.</description>
