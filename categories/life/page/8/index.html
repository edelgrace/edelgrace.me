<h3 id="day-14-rest-day">Day 14: Rest Day</h3>

<p>Ummm, what?? It&rsquo;s rest day already?? I do not believe it. I&rsquo;ve been at this for two weeks now! I feel proud of myself, I never thought I would be able to make it this far. I&rsquo;m officially halfway through the calendar! I decided not to do a workout video today because I&rsquo;ve been so tired and lethargic lately and all of my limbs feel sore. I know this sounds like an excuse but at the moment, I&rsquo;m feeling pretty scared about my health. Recently I started taking a medication and the side effects have been less than stellar. I&rsquo;m trying not to feel too bad about it though because today is &ldquo;rest day&rdquo; after all.</p>

<h3 id="video-1-berrylicious-microwave-minute-muffin">Video 1: Berrylicious Microwave Minute Muffin</h3>

<p>I never actually try these recipes but they are pretty intriguing&#8230; I think I might try this tomorrow morning.</p>

<h3 id="day-13-total-body">Day 13: Total Body</h3>

<h3 id="video-1-5-minute-fat-burner">Video 1: 5 Minute Fat Burner</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Five minutes? Easy peasey.&rdquo; I was so wrong! Cassey wasn&rsquo;t lying when she said it would be tough. This was a hard video, with lots of suffering included (guaranteed).</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Star Jump:</em> These were really hard to do quietly. I definitely started sweating immediately with this move.</li>
<li><em>In and Out Donkey Kicks:</em> All of my workout times are too inconvenient for the people in my house, haha. I tried to be really quiet so I didn&rsquo;t do the kicks too forcefully. I&rsquo;d love to be able to do these moves without worrying about sound.</li>
<li><em>Burpees:</em> I did the silent burpee version but I did add the push up. This really made me start breathing heavily. I hate burpees so much!</li>
<li><em>Mountain Climbers:</em> My feet kept slipping on the rug, haha. This was kind of fun and quick although it was pretty hard!</li>
<li><em>Split Squat Jumps:</em> I&rsquo;m sure my parents were grumbling as I was doing this move. I tried my best not to jump too high but it&rsquo;s inevitable to make some noise whenever jumping is involved.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-2-push-plank-challenger">Video 2: Push Plank Challenger</h3>

<p>This video is essentially just one move. One. Excruciating. Move. I did the &ldquo;beginner&rsquo;s&rdquo; version of this move but I still had trouble. My arms are sore after that! I&rsquo;m really weak&#8230; Thank goodness for this calendar!</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="video-3-killer-legs">Video 3: Killer Legs</h3>

<p>Another short video, which is interesting&#8230; Short but KILLER, as the title would suggest. This is another video that depends on reps over a period of time. So much repetition today!</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Narrow Squat Slider:</em> This move is harder than the other move, which is interesting. My legs were really feeling this one.</li>
<li><em>Narrow Squat Lifter:</em> I don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s easier to lift than to simply extend me leg to the side&#8230; Maybe I didn&rsquo;t lift my leg high enough although I consciously tried to lift my legs as high as possible. Something to work on, probably.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>Three short and brutal videos today. The last video wasn&rsquo;t that bad but the first two definitely got beads of sweat rolling down my neck! I actually prefer that, for some reason. I love it when I sweat from working out. It feels like I&rsquo;m actually doing work. I didn&rsquo;t work to my fullest potential today but I was trying to keep quiet. The only time I can do my workouts are early morning or late at night. Both of those times, someone is sleeping in the house. What a dilemma&#8230; I need to figure that out.</p>

<h3 id="day-12-abs">Day 12: Abs</h3>

<p>Ab workouts are so brutal&#8230; And, of course, that&rsquo;s what everyone wants to workout. Cue the suffering.</p>

<h3 id="video-1-ab-butt-workout">Video 1: Ab &amp; Butt Workout</h3>

<p>I seriously cannot get over how cute Rosanna is! She is absolutely adorable and when she struggles, I feel like I&rsquo;m not alone in ab hell. Somehow, she smiles through all of it! Workout goals&#8230;</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Scissors:</em> Literally the only easy workout in this video.</li>
<li><em>One Leg Crunch:</em> I still keep using my neck instead of my core to do these but it&rsquo;s so hard for me to lift up my shoulders still.</li>
<li><em>Roll ups:</em> Thank goodness for roll ups (again).</li>
<li><em>Balancing Pilates Stances:</em> Thankfully, I made a better attempt at this one compared to last week.</li>
<li><em>Fire Hydrant:</em> For the first time, I actually felt my butt working in this move&#8230; This was another move that was easier this time around!</li>
<li><em>Plank Twists:</em> Add this move to my &ldquo;Edel actually did it this time!&rdquo; list. I don&rsquo;t know what it was but they were easier this week. Although my feet kept pushing away the rug from my feet.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-2-abs-on-fire">Video 2: Abs on Fire</h3>

<p>Cassey was not joking about the title when she named this video &ldquo;abs on fire.&rdquo; My abs&#8230; Were definitely on fire.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Genie Abs:</em> These&#8230; were surprisingly okay! I&rsquo;m really bad at using my core. It wasn&rsquo;t until Cassey made it harder did I start to struggle a little.</li>
<li><em>Eagle Abs:</em> This move is very&#8230; Twisty! I suck at any variation of crunches so this was not a fun move. I don&rsquo;t think I did it right at all. I ended up just holding onto my knees whenever I went up.</li>
<li><em>Runaway Abs:</em> What a cute move. It was hard though because it always hurts to try to lift my shoulders off the floor. I could feel my shoulder blades digging into the ground.</li>
<li><em>Double Leg Stretch/Star Abs:</em> This was hard and I didn&rsquo;t have much room to do these properly. But I really tried to do these. Once again, once Cassey added a little more difficulty to the move, I tried it but just ended up doing the simple version again.</li>
<li><em>Clock Abs:</em> I do not like clock abs! I find it so hard to do and my hips go all over the place. But I tried my best, even if it was at a snail&rsquo;s pace.</li>
<li><em>Hollow Rock:</em> I could not do these very well! I kept sitting up all the way which is what is not what I was supposed to do, I&rsquo;m guessing.</li>
<li><em>Single Leg Drop:</em> You&rsquo;d think this move would be easy but I actually had some trouble with this one. But I pushed through it despite skipping some of the harder variations (completely by accident, I used my phone to watch this video and put it down without checking to see if anything changed).</li>
<li><em>Cheerleader L&rsquo;s:</em> There are two reasons why I was never a cheerleader. A) I have no flexibility or physical ability at all. B) We never had cheerleaders at my high school. So this move was really hard. I could barely do it. Actually, I couldn&rsquo;t do it! I just did it half-halfheartedly.</li>
<li><em>Earthquake:</em> Cassey said to expect shaking. Boy did the shaking happen. Every time Cassey said &ldquo;lower!&rdquo; I laughed and held my position. I did try to go as low as I could but it was not low enough at all.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-3-relax-with-me-stretch">Video 3: Relax with Me Stretch</h3>

<p>I was a little wary doing the stretches because on Friday I was stretching and gave myself a charley horse. The beach scenery was a nice touch. Typical California. I want sun too&#8230;</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Rise and Shine:</em> A move with almost no effort. Just a nice start to the stretching. I felt like a weird flower or something.</li>
<li><em>Side Bend Stretch:</em> Another easy move. My left side was feeling a little sore so I tried my best not to overdo it.</li>
<li><em>Half Rainbow Glute:</em> My left side was definitely not stretched out enough due to my soreness but my right side was feeling nice and taut!</li>
<li><em>Stretching Child/Mini Child Press:</em> Ramping up the difficulty just a tad bit. Presses are hard for me no matter what. But it was still relatively easy.</li>
<li><em>Down Dog:</em> This move actually made me sweaty. How do stretches make me more sweaty than the actual workout itself??</li>
<li><em>Dogging Cobra:</em> This move made me even more sweatier. I got pretty tired by the end and really had to push through it.</li>
<li><em>Head Rolls:</em> Is it a little weird how I&rsquo;m paranoid about cracking my neck? Usually it feels good but I&rsquo;m guessing I had no knots to straighten out today.</li>
<li><em>Soul Stretch:</em> This is definitely a move that makes you sigh with relief. I love the stretch in this one!</li>
<li><em>Long Lunge Twist:</em> My balance was tested in this move. I have no balance.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>It was pretty disheartening to read the comments on the Blogilates page about people feeling discourage by today&rsquo;s videos. The &ldquo;Abs on Fire&rdquo; video was definitely hard and a little outside of my difficulty range. I stumbled through that video and didn&rsquo;t really &ldquo;complete&rdquo; it at all. But I know that I suck at the moment and I&rsquo;m not strong enough and I accepted it. Maybe this the only advantage of being self deprecating all the time? So if you&rsquo;re feeling demotivated by the &ldquo;Abs on Fire&rdquo; video, it&rsquo;s okay. As long as you even attempt some of the moves, you are making progress. You&rsquo;re not there YET but if you keep pushing through, you will be there eventually!</p>

<h3 id="day-11-lower-body">Day 11: Lower Body</h3>

<p>Another day, another week almost finished (I&rsquo;m talking in terms of the weekday week and not the Blogilates week)! I keep mixing up the &ldquo;Wake up and &#8230;&rdquo; preambles at the start of each day&#8230;. Yesterday I did 30 second planks on each side instead of just 1 minute of planking. I really hate those planks&#8230; You will not hear me say that enough, haha!</p>

<h3 id="video-1-pick-me-up-quickie-workout">Video 1: Pick Me Up Quickie Workout</h3>

<p>Cassey is totally peppy and first thing in the morning, I&rsquo;m not quite sure if I&rsquo;m feeling the happiness. But this is a new workout video so I tried to give it a shot.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Dogging Cobra:</em> This move is fun to do! I didn&rsquo;t find it too hard but like with any move, with more repetitions, it got more tiring to do. Cassey said it really wakes you up, especially early in the morning and she is right, haha.</li>
<li><em>Clam Kicks:</em> I find this move really interesting. My bones kept cracking with this one, on both legs. This doesn&rsquo;t get as tiring as other moves in this video.</li>
<li><em>Single Arm Press:</em> I found this move really hard! My hip (?) bone kept pressing down into the floor and it hurt. I even pulled out a rug to put under me to make it hurt less, haha!</li>
<li><em>Boat Teaser:</em> I could not do this move at the pace Cassey did it. I don&rsquo;t have a strong enough core to lift myself up. I probably approached it wrong because I did it like a roll up and then attempted to bring my legs in. Whoops.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-2-body-slimming-workout">Video 2: Body Slimming Workout</h3>

<p>Since I already listed the moves in this workout previously, I&rsquo;m not going to attempt to list them out again. I did much better this time around. Those hundreds still kill me. I really need to work on my Pilates stance. Fortunately, I was actually able to do the parachuters move this time around! I love these confidence boosting videos, haha.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="video-3-6-minutes-to-sexy-thighs">Video 3: 6 Minutes to Sexy Thighs</h3>

<p>Not really liking the title of this video because it makes me feel a little vain or shallow, haha.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Criss Cross Scissors:</em> I think this is the easiest move in this video. It was kind of fun as well. I closed my eyes for a bit, like Cassey suggested. It was kind of humorous listening to Cassey, a California girl, talk about the cold. Try living where there&rsquo;s snow!</li>
<li><em>Froggers:</em> This one is also kind of easy compared to the other ones in this workout. It&rsquo;s more tiring than the criss cross scissors but not as tiring as some of the other moves in today&rsquo;s videos.</li>
<li><em>Double Leg Lift Presses:</em> This one was a struggle. I have trouble with the double leg lift to begin with and adding those presses made it even more difficult.</li>
<li><em>Leg Side Press:</em> I&rsquo;m tempted to say these were the hardest moves in this video. Staying up and resisting the urge to sink to the floor was hard. The actual move was SO tiring. It was a relief when Cassey spent less time on the last side, haha.</li>

<p>This is the first time I&rsquo;ve done a workout <em>first thing</em> in the morning. Okay, I admit, I kind of browsed on my phone for a quick few minutes and then I worked out but it&rsquo;s close enough for me! The first video was a little hard, the second video was a good motivation booster, and the last workout was definitely a challenge. I also actually got sweaty today doing these. Surprisingly enough, it was during the video that was the easiest for me, the body slimming workout!</p>

<h3 id="day-10-abs">Day 10: Abs</h3>

<p>The day starts off with two thirty second planks on each side. How I hate planks&#8230; But I did it anyway, even if I cheated for a couple seconds on each. There&rsquo;s only one new video today and I decided that I wouldn&rsquo;t list all the moves for the other videos again in the interest of time and because I don&rsquo;t really have anything to say about specific moves.</p>

<h3 id="video-1-ab-time">Video 1: Ab Time</h3>

<p>This video is so simple and without graphics, it&rsquo;s so weird now that I&rsquo;m used to her more recent videos! The moves are considerably easier this time around. I was able to do the plank and plank variations which made me pretty happy!</p>

<h3 id="video-2-bubble-butt-workout">Video 2: Bubble Butt Workout</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m a little skeptical on the whole butt thing (is lifting my butt a good thing even if I have absolutely no butt?) but I did this workout anyway. I was able to go through this entire video without cheating. The grasshopper move at the end is still pretty hard for me. I&rsquo;m getting bonier and my hips hurt being pushed to the ground&#8230; Otherwise, I think my butt is on it&rsquo;s way to become a butt!</p>

<h3 id="video-3-best-stretches-for-chilling-out">Video 3: Best Stretches for Chilling Out</h3>

<p>These stretches feel so good afterwards! Early in the day I got a Charliehorse in one leg and almost in the other so I didn&rsquo;t push myself as much as I could have. I just hate cramping up. Obviously I need to do more stretches and drink more water.</p>

<p>Today was an overall good day! In the morning I went to my spin class. We had a different instructor today and he worked us HARD. But the things he did were so fun and really did include some familiar pilates moves. A lot of working out in my core. However, the post stretch workout gave me a Charlie horse in my right leg and it was pretty sore until the evening. I also spent a good amount of the day walking around as I walked to the clinic to see a doctor (nothing serious, don&rsquo;t worry).</p>

<p>The Blogilates workouts today was definitely a feel good motivator. It&rsquo;s great seeing some sort of progress. Maybe that means tomorrow will be especially hard! I&rsquo;m expecting to receive the March calendar soon so maybe I&rsquo;ll do them in parallel and see if that ramps up the difficulty. It makes me a little nervous knowing how the workouts can get harder. Some of the days seem so hard already! Well, I guess I just gotta push through.</p>
