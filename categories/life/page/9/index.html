<h3 id="day-9-abs">Day 9: Abs</h3>

<h3 id="video-1-total-body-workout">Video 1: Total Body Workout</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to list the moves for this video again because my comments are mostly the same from the last time I did this video. I really am progressing with those pull ups. Not once did I have to grab my legs! However I do rely on my momentum more rather than my core, but still. This might be old news but I still hate the hundred move&#8230; It totally hurts my neck and I know I&rsquo;m doing it wrong but I just can&rsquo;t do it right, yet.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="video-2-abc-abs">Video 2: ABC Abs</h3>

<p>I won&rsquo;t list the moves to this video either because there are only two moves. The first one is a position where you have to draw letters in your air using your arms. It&rsquo;s hard because it&rsquo;s in a Pilates stance. I had to pause a couple of times to regain my composure. The second move is the same thing but with the legs and different positioning. My tailbone really bothers me a lot when it comes to these exercise. So I struggled doing this one as well, but not as much as I did with the first one.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>My overall thoughts for today? I hate ABC Abs, haha! I think they are the hardest moves so far in this calendar. It now feels like I&rsquo;ve been doing it forever but it&rsquo;s only day nine! Time flies&#8230; Can I just fast forward to the end where I&rsquo;m string and fit and can eat cheat food!</p>

<h3 id="day-8-total-body">Day 8: Total Body</h3>

<p>After my &ldquo;rest day&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve been missing Cassey a little. It&rsquo;s hard to believe that it&rsquo;s already the second week! It doesn&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s been that long&#8230;</p>

<h3 id="video-1-indoor-cardio-workout">Video 1: Indoor Cardio Workout</h3>

<p>I wish I had more time to do workouts in the morning because when it comes to the cardio videos, I just can&rsquo;t do them 100% without making a bunch of noise. I workout at night which is the most convenient time for me. I did get my heart rate up though, even if I didn&rsquo;t do the workout to my fullest.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="video-2-body-slimming-workout">Video 2: Body Slimming Workout</h3>

<p>This &ldquo;body slimming&rdquo; workout is essentially a rehash of the beginner&rsquo;s pilate video Cassey made. I enjoy the better quality a lot!</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Roll Ups:</em> I&rsquo;m slowly working my way up from an assisted to non-assisted roll up! I can do a couple of roll ups now without holding onto my legs, however my feet kind of lift off the ground but it&rsquo;s progress!</li>
<li><em>Pilates Stance:</em> This move is okay, I&rsquo;m finding it easier to hold myself up but I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m holding myself up high enough.</li>
<li><em>The Hundred:</em> These still are pretty hard for me but when Cassey turned from table top to straight let, I was surprised at how it didn&rsquo;t get much harder. I can feel myself do these better and without as much strain in my neck!</li>
<li><em>Bridge Pulses:</em> This is a new move! At first it felt really easy to do but then I started to really feel it in my butt. Now, whenever Cassey says, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll feel it in your butt,&rdquo; I never do so this is a first for me.</li>
<li><em>Double Leg Lift:</em> I still don&rsquo;t know how to position my hands so that my tailbone doesn&rsquo;t hurt&#8230;</li>
<li><em>Half Cobra Pushup:</em> The cobra moves are a little bit more easier to do every time.</li>
<li><em>Parachuter:</em> Another new move! This move is cool but I have no idea if I&rsquo;m doing it right. I feels like I&rsquo;m lifting my body up but again, is it high enough? I don&rsquo;t know.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-3-stretches-to-relieve-lower-back-pain">Video 3: Stretches to Relieve Lower Back Pain</h3>

<p>I tend to slouch a lot but lately I&rsquo;m becoming more conscious of my posture. My back surprisingly hurts more than usual so I was hoping these would help me in some way.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Seated Twist:</em> These felt really good! I do a variation of this whenever I&rsquo;m sitting down.</li>
<li><em>Pretzel:</em> Cassey claims that this move was a typical gym class move but I&rsquo;m not sure I remember it! I didn&rsquo;t feel this one as much but it was surprising to me to find out that I&rsquo;m more flexible on my right compared to my left side.</li>
<li><em>Cobra:</em> I just can&rsquo;t seem to escape the cobras&#8230; Maybe that&rsquo;s a good thing because it&rsquo;s the thing that I need to work on the most!</li>
<li><em>Scorpion Twist:</em> Hmmm, I don&rsquo;t really see the correlation with a scorpion but this was a fun move regardless. I didn&rsquo;t have much room to do these but it was still a good stretch.</li>
<li><em>Cat-Dog:</em> This reminds me of like otso-otso in slow motion. Below my shoulders it kind of started to hurt. I didn&rsquo;t feel much of a stretch but I really tried to mimic the ost-otso flow, haha!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>First day of week 2 is over! Today was a little slow with the recap and just a couple of new moves. The cardio wasn&rsquo;t as heart pumping as I wanted it to be, solely my fault. I&rsquo;m a little skeptical of the stretches videos because they seem so &ldquo;complimentary&rdquo; to the cardio and workout video but it&rsquo;s a good way to wind down!</p>

<h3 id="day-7-rest-day">Day 7: Rest Day</h3>

<p>Thank goodness for the rest day. Technically there is 30 minutes left of day 7 and I feel like I should be doing something. So I&rsquo;m searching for some quick videos to do before midnight hits. I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve done a week of this already! Here&rsquo;s to four more weeks!</p>

<h3 id="video-1-two-ingredient-banana-pancakes">Video 1: Two Ingredient Banana Pancakes</h3>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t try these mostly because I had ate all of my calories by the time I got to doing the calendar. I&rsquo;ve heard many mixed reviews about these &ldquo;pancakes.&rdquo; They&rsquo;re simply just eggs and banana fried together. It sounds really weird and I&rsquo;m doubting whether or not they actually taste good. I&rsquo;m a horrible cook but I would like to try them one day.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="video-2-quiet-cardio-workout-fitnessblender">Video 2: Quiet Cardio Workout (FitnessBlender)</h3>

<p>Okay, today I cheated. Today is a &ldquo;rest day&rdquo; after all! I didn&rsquo;t feel good about not doing any workouts today. I had to do something, at least. It&rsquo;s nearly midnight now and I decided to do a quiet workout since most of the house is asleep. There are 10 exercises in this workout, repeated twice for a total of around 20 minutes.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>4 Torso Twists &amp; 2 Kicks:</em> This is an easy move but it got my heart pumping right away!</li>
<li><em>X Squats:</em> I hate X squats so much! They&rsquo;re not hard but really tiring. I was breathing pretty heavily at this point.</li>
<li><em>Deadlift Jacks:</em> I actually like this one except I didn&rsquo;t have enough room to do them in my office (AKA my study room). I tried my best though, and ended up making weird angles.</li>
<li><em>Up &amp; Over Steps and Knees:</em> This is another easy one but kind of difficult to do it quietly! I like how these workouts emphasize how quiet you&rsquo;re trying to be.</li>
<li><em>Slow Squats &amp; Hooks:</em> Okay, I hate these too! Do you see a trend here? Squats and planks are not my friends. It kinda feel fun to be punching the air though&#8230;</li>
<li><em>Quiet Burpees:</em> I did these earlier in the week when one of the days required burpees. It was kind of cheating but I really needed to be quiet that day because I usually exercise at night when everyone is sleeping/falling asleep.</li>
<li><em>Arm &amp; Leg Balance Swings:</em> This is an easy exercise. I just have no balance sometimes. I really tried to focus on contracting my arms and legs but I keep forgetting about my core.</li>
<li><em>3 Twists &amp; Knee Ups:</em> I always get confused with the rhythm of this move and I get behind compared to the person on the screen. I think I&rsquo;m tempted to do four twists instead of three.</li>
<li><em>Plank Tucks &amp; Extensions:</em> Planks!!!! My number one enemy. Admittedly, these are the easiest variation of planks that I&rsquo;ve done this week. I really hate planks. Maybe one day I can do them without complaining&#8230;</li>
<li><em>Low Lateral Steps:</em> This &ldquo;completely depends on how quiet you are.&rdquo; Seriously. Go too fast and you make a lot of noise whenever you put your feet to the ground. I always feel myself gaining momentum. At least the workout ends on an easy note.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Rest day.&rdquo; I think every rest day I will still exercise for maybe ten to twenty minutes with someone other than Cassey. Maybe next week I&rsquo;ll actually try her recipes because I&rsquo;ve been so hungry lately!</p>

<p>With the cardio workout, I felt like I sweat buckets. It was almost as if I sweat more in this twenty minutes than the entire week! To be fair, there isn&rsquo;t a lot of cardio in Cassey&rsquo;s workouts. They mostly focus on strength and toning. I&rsquo;d like to include more cardio into my week. I already have a spin class every week which is just once a week for 50 minutes. Cassey does sometimes include some cardio but I feel like it&rsquo;s not enough.</p>

<p>Also, they say that workouts should make you feel awake but as soon as the workout was over, I became instantly tired. Time to hit the hay I guess. I also probably need to eat more whenever I do cardio&#8230;</p>

<h3 id="day-6-total-body">Day 6: Total Body</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Wake up and do 15 crunches.&rdquo; I did four roll ups instead. And I never do these when I wake up, usually it&rsquo;s the last thing I do before bed. Not today though!</p>

<h3 id="video-1-cardio-warmup">Video 1: Cardio Warmup</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m really glad Cassey puts some cardio videos because most of her workouts are focusing on toning and my main goal is to burn fat and not really &ldquo;bulk&rdquo; up.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Pile Squat:</em> Thank goodness the first workout was relatively easy! It was kind of fun too.</li>
<li><em>Leg Kick:</em> These weren&rsquo;t bad either.</li>
<li><em>Jumping Jacks and Cross Jack:</em> I cheated a little because I didn&rsquo;t want to be too loud jumping all over the place.</li>
<li><em>Narrow Squat:</em> These were okay too! I felt weird doing this move, haha.</li>
<li><em>Lunges:</em> Lunges are okay. I&rsquo;m loving how easy the cardio is.</li>
<li><em>Walking Plank:</em> Planks are my weakness. I struggled with this even though it&rsquo;s pretty easy.</li>
<li><em>Dancing Dog:</em> These were harder after doing those planks but the burn definitely felt good, strangely.</li>
<li><em>Plank Walker Opener:</em> I could do these, but only at a slower pace. I felt the burn on this one too.</li>
<li><em>Walking Plank:</em> These was hard! Planks, like I said, are my worst moves.</li>
<li><em>Caterpillars:</em> This move is really fun! I kind of left out the push up at the end some times but I really liked this move.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-2-6-minutes-to-sexy-arms">Video 2: 6 Minutes to Sexy Arms</h3>

<p>Cassey wasn&rsquo;t lying when she said that girls don&rsquo;t really work out their arms. A lot of the comments on this video were (presumably females) complaining about how they didn&rsquo;t like how their arms were bulkier. Everyone wants to slim and not necessarily get muscly, haha!</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Arm Circles:</em> &ldquo;Arm circles of death&rdquo; is right. These are so hard after some time. Cassey is so perky during this workout and I couldn&rsquo;t stop swearing, haha. I wish I could have her attitude whenever I workout.</li>
<li><em>Pushers:</em> This looks easy but if you do it right (which I&rsquo;m pretty sure I did), it will BURN. Even Cassey comments on the burn that she feels. Arms are so hard to do!</li>
<li><em>Chest Press Pulse:</em> Why do these look so easy but are so hard to do?? I kept fighting the urge to open up my elbows in this video. Cassey switches it up with the frequency of the pulses which kind of keeps your mind off how much longer you have.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don&rsquo;t really care to learn how to do the splits so I mostly skipped this video but did try some of the stretches here. Maybe I&rsquo;ll use them for my spin class!</p>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>Today was KILLER on the arms! And my upper body was super sore from yesterday as well. I think pain = progress? I&rsquo;m not sure. I&rsquo;m glad this workout was really hard but I still managed to do really well and push through most of the moves. I&rsquo;m really looking forward to rest day tomorrow!</p>

<p>Usually I do these around 11 pm but today I found myself with an hour and managed to do it once I got home from school. The whole week last week, I was off of school due to reading week so I had more than enough time to do these. I&rsquo;m a little worried that now school is starting back up again, I might be able to stay on track. I hope not! I might resort to doing half of the workout in the morning and half in the afternoon. We&rsquo;ll see what will happen.</p>

<h3 id="day-5-abs">Day 5: Abs</h3>

<p>Okay I switched up the preambles in the calendar because apparently I can&rsquo;t read. Day three I was supposed to plank for 30 seconds, yesterday I was supposed to do the burpees, and today I was supposed to drink an 8 oz of water. Whoops! So I compensated today by not only drinking the water but also doing the plank. I hate planks so much, they hurt! But no pain, no gain, I guess.</p>

<h3 id="video-1-total-body-workout">Video 1: Total Body Workout</h3>

<p>This video is the same video from the first day. Maybe it&rsquo;s meant as a confidence booster to show how much you&rsquo;ve progressed over the last five days.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Pilates stance:</em> I&rsquo;ll admit, I still struggle with this but it doesn&rsquo;t hurt as much and I can feel my abs working more.</li>
<li><em>Roll ups:</em> I love roll ups even though I can&rsquo;t 100% do them. I did ONE proper roll up without trying to support myself and it made so happy!.</li>
<li><em>Leg stuff:</em> This time around I did more of this without having to rest. Those pyramids are still tough but I can at least make it until that point without resting for a bit.</li>
<li><em>Cobra position:</em> My arms still hate these.</li>
<li><em>Elbow push ups:</em> Less sucky compared to last time but still sucky.</li>
<li><em>Mermaid stretches:</em> This move is so pretty and really easy! Nothing much has changed since the first time I did them.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-2-abs-and-butt-workout">Video 2: Abs and Butt Workout</h3>

<p>I love how Cassey keeps bringing on guests onto her videos so we don&rsquo;t get tired of her, haha. The guest this time is Rosanna from the YouTube channel Nerd Nummies. Makes sense, a chef should probably try their best to stay healthy. Ro is SO cute.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Scissors:</em> These were a pretty easy way to start off a workout, thank goodness! It definitely got my heart pumping.</li>
<li><em>One Leg Crunch:</em> Like Ro, I definitely had to do the easier variant of this move. Crunches/sit ups are so hard for me. I feel like I&rsquo;m continuously using my neck instead of my abs. How do I used my abs??</li>
<li><em>Roll ups:</em> Thank goodness for roll ups.</li>
<li><em>Balancing Pilates Stances:</em> Also like Ro, I totally struggled with this one. My sense of balance is really off.</li>
<li><em>Fire Hydrant:</em> This one got me tired really fast. My legs were on fire! But it&rsquo;s all for the butt so I guess it&rsquo;s okay.</li>
<li><em>Plank Twists:</em> Oh gosh this was hard for me! I kept collapsing to the floor. Planks are not my strong point. I&rsquo;ll probably have to work on that.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>My heart definitely got pumping in this workout! I was slightly disappointed how I wasn&rsquo;t able to do all of the first video flawlessly but I did feel some improvement. One day, I will get there. I really enjoyed Ro&rsquo;s prescence in the second video because it was a reminder that not everyone can get the moves right away 100% of the time. Sometimes I forget there are normal people like me doing these videos. I think today was really fun and I can&rsquo;t wait for tomorrow!</p>
