          <p><p>Okay, I know that probably isn&rsquo;t a lot compared to other bloggers out there but to me, that&rsquo;s mind blowing. 9 years is around 40% of my life and that percentage will only keep on increasing. Assuming that I continue blogging. As long as I can type, I don&rsquo;t think I would stop blogging. Sure, my blogging might be extremely sporadic but it&rsquo;s still blogging to me.</p>

<p>Actually, I was going through my archive and I read <a href="http://scattered.me/2007/02/bouncy/">a blog post</a> that was from exactly six years and two days ago. That&rsquo;s <strong>3289</strong> days ago. I laughed to myself abouut how some things just don&rsquo;t change.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t posted in a while.&rdquo;</em> This is me like every single time I post something. How is this still true even today? &ldquo;I need to post more,&rdquo; I say to myself every year.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too much of a perfectionist.&rdquo;</em> My second most fatal flaw. My first being that I&rsquo;m a procrastinator, which I&rsquo;m 99.9% sure that I was one back then. It&rsquo;s honestly the deadliest combination against productivity.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;My mom keeps complaining on how I’m &#8216;losing weight.&lsquo;&rdquo;</em> I literally got into a (civil) argument with my mom about my weight yesterday. I&rsquo;ve been trying to get toned (hence all the recent fitness posts) because I have always been conscious of my large gut. I&rsquo;m at a perfect weight for my height I just want to reduce my body fat percentage to get that flat stomach look. They say doing so is 80% diet and 20% exercise. I don&rsquo;t mind gaining weight through muscles.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Live performances always rekindle my love for a band.&rdquo;</em> Just recently I&rsquo;ve been <strong>obsessed</strong> with the post-hardcore Canadian band Alexisonfire. This was because, by some chance, I watched an hour long concert on YouTube of theirs from last year. It was mind blowing how perfect they were in that concert. I used to like Alexisonfire a lot when I was in junior high but watching this concert made my love for them grow tenfold. I never realized how great they were as a band.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;I am so tired right now.&rdquo;</em> They say nine years later that she is still tired today.</p>

<h3 id="day-4-lower-body">Day 4: Lower Body</h3>

<p>The little preamble for today in the calendar simply said to drink a glass of 8 oz of water. I have no idea what 8 oz looks like. Or how much any other measurements of liquids look like for that matter. So I just drank a regular glass of water.</p>

<p>I was definitely wondering why there was no simple warm up today and then I clicked to see the videos. There are <em>three</em> videos today. Oh. That&rsquo;s why!</p>

<h3 id="video-1-cardio-warm-up">Video 1: Cardio Warm Up</h3>

<p>This first video isn&rsquo;t exactly pilates but is something out of like a dance workout DVD. It&rsquo;s very high energy (it is cardio after all) and it totally got me sweating a little. There are no named moves in this workout, Cassey just speeds through them all, which is understandable.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="video-2-inner-thighs">Video 2: Inner Thighs</h3>

<p>This video is a bit of fun! Cassey lets a few of her fans come on screen for this session. On my first viewing of this video, I really inspected each of the fans in the background. It was a little bit relieving to see some more faces. There was this one girl who was absolutely adorable, she looked like she was struggling but she did it all with a smile on her face! She&rsquo;s laugh every single time she was straining, haha!</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Frogger:</em> I feel like I&rsquo;ve gotten better at holding my legs in midair! I definitely felt this one though.</li>
<li><em>Froggy Heel Kicks:</em> At first it seems really simple but legs got tired fast!</li>
<li><em>Frogger Heel Touch:</em> A variant of frogger, obviously. It&rsquo;s harder so I prefer plain old vanilla frogger.</li>
<li><em>Inner Thigh Side Raise:</em> This was hard! The position of the foot is a little weird and I slipped up a couple of times but when I didn&rsquo;t, I felt it.</li>
<li><em>Inner Thigh Lift:</em> Another hard move but not nearly as hard as the previous one. My legs tire easily apparently&#8230;</li>
<li><em>Pile Squat Pulses:</em> Squats make me nervous so I was not looking forward to this one. It actually wasn&rsquo;t as bad as I thought it would be!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-3-how-to-do-a-handstand">Video 3: How to do a Handstand</h3>

<p>I skipped this video as I&rsquo;m not really interested in doing a handstand. I&rsquo;m way too scared to try and attempt it! Maybe I should have done it but eh.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>I feel so accomplished, this was the first day where I didn&rsquo;t have to pause the video or take a couple seconds of rest during a move. I made it from start to finish! I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m getting used to it or if Cassey made this day deliberately easy like yesterday. I hope it&rsquo;s the former. I actually enjoy doing this when I can actually do it!</p>

<h3 id="day-2-abs">Day 2: Abs</h3>

<p>Today&rsquo;s workout is split into two videos. Both target your abs however they vary in difficulty. It&rsquo;s worth noting that spot reduction (focusing on working out a specific part of your body to lose fat in that one specific area) is a myth. It&rsquo;s only when your overall body fat percentage lowers that will you see results and they will be present around your whole body and not in just one area. What targeting certain areas does do is help strengthen them but fat will not necessarily be lost there specifically.</p>

<p>Anyway, the day starts off with 10 sit-ups. I have an embarrassing confession to make. I have completely forgotten how to do a sit-up! Well, I remember how it should be done, but I cannot actually do it anymore. The last time I did a sit-up was in middle school. That was nearly six years ago&#8230; Maybe it&rsquo;s because whenever we did sit-ups, we were anchored by someone holding our feet. Even then, I remember it being so hard. So instead, I did a couple of roll-ups because I can somewhat do those.</p>

<h3 id="video-1-ab-time">Video 1: Ab Time!</h3>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<p>Onto the first real workout. The first video is considerably &ldquo;easy&rdquo; (at least, compared to the second one). Cassey goes through the following exercises:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Roll ups:</em> I warmed up with the roll ups but I didn&rsquo;t mind doing it yet again.</li>
<li><em>The corkscrew:</em> It&rsquo;s weird because I had a lot of trouble keeping my balance with this one. I found my hips shifting all over the place. It didn&rsquo;t get tiring but it was just plain hard to do.</li>
<li><em>Oblique dippers:</em> These are like side push-ups on one hand. They feel deceivingly easy because it&rsquo;s surprisingly easy to do wrong. Cassey gives tips on how to make it harder or easier for you, depending on how you feel.</li>
<li><em>Planks:</em> The dreaded plank&#8230; I have zero strength so this was hard. Casey goes through different variations of planking.</li>
<li><em>Elbow to knee plank:</em> I&rsquo;ve actually done this exercise before, when I used to do Fitness Blender videos! For some reason, it felt especially tougher to them this time around. But I actually enjoy this move. If only I had more room in my bedroom to do it! I had move a couple of furniture around.</li>
<li><em>Knee to chest plank:</em> This is another move that I&rsquo;m familiar with, due to Fitness Blender. I never liked these and I still don&rsquo;t like them.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-2-10-minute-ab-sculpting-workout">Video 2: 10 Minute Ab Sculpting Workout</h3>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<p>The second video is &ldquo;just&rdquo; 10 minutes of ab sculpting. I found it extremely hard! At the beginning of the video, Cassey even warns you about the incoming suffering and torture she is about to put you through. Great&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Genie twist:</em> This hurt my shoulders because I kept hitting my floor hard. I also felt a little bit silly because it felt like I was just flailing on the floor, haha.</li>
<li><em>Butterfly crunch:</em> I was able to do this one, although I was a lot slower than Cassey in doing it but at least I could do it properly.</li>
<li><em>Crunch cross, straight leg crunch cross, and advanced straight crunch cross:</em> Okay. While doing these, I had to pause the video and lay on my floor for a minute or two to contemplate my life. I&rsquo;m not even exaggerating. These were the hardest moves in the entire workout for me. My neck hurt a lot doing just two in a row. Probably a sign that I was doing it wrong but still. It&rsquo;s a struggle for me to keep my shoulders off the floor. Honestly, I did just the regular crunch cross and some of the straight leg crunch cross because the more advance variations were too much for me.</li>
<li><em>V sit-up:</em> These were hard since I can&rsquo;t even do a regular sit-up but I attempted these as much as I could. I actually felt like I was more capable of doing these over the regular sit-ups except I knew I didn&rsquo;t have the exact &ldquo;V&rdquo; shape that Cassey had.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>If you think I complained a lot, you&rsquo;re right. As someone who doesn&rsquo;t do much physical activity, I struggled A LOT. I don&rsquo;t like exercise but it seems to be a necessary evil. This is a journey and hopefully it will get easier as time goes one. Maybe I just need to push myself harder. So if you can&rsquo;t take my complaining, feel free to avoid reading my fitness posts.</p>

<p>Today was so much harder than yesterday. There were a few easier moves in this day but overall, it was hard! I swore a lot under my breath. It felt like I worked harder but not necessarily better. Tomorrow I think I will put more effort on doing the workout accurately. My downside is that I tried to figure out the moves as Cassey went through the workout. So by the time I had some semblance of what to do, she moves onto the next move. Next time I&rsquo;ll pause the video and resume it when I feel ready to do so.</p>

<p>I also watch the videos on my phone and it&rsquo;s kind of hard trying to do the exercise and watch what&rsquo;s happening. Maybe I should watch them on my laptop? I could technically watch them on the TV as well but I&rsquo;d rather have the privacy of my own room while I&rsquo;m doing exercise. I think I must look silly, especially when I&rsquo;m not doing the workouts properly!</p>

<p>So today was a tough day. Tomorrow will be equally or even more harder but I&rsquo;ll just brace myself as much as possible.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This &ldquo;review&rdquo;/blog series is NOT sponsored in any way and all opinions are entirely of my own.</p>

<p>My first post of 2016! This year I resolved to get healthier. That is, eat healthier and be more active! I&rsquo;ve been hanging out on the <a href="http://reddit.com/r/xxfitness">/r/xxfitness: Fitness for Women</a> subreddit a lot lately. Since I&rsquo;m hesitant to go to the gym, someone suggested I try <a href="http://blogilates.com">Blogilates</a>, ran by Cassey Ho. I browsed the site a bit and decided to try the <a href="http://www.blogilates.com/blog/2014/12/30/new-beginners-calendar-2-0-for-2015/">Beginner&rsquo;s Workout Calendar</a> which lasts for four weeks.</p>

<h3 id="quick-facts-about-blogilates">Quick facts about Blogilates</h3>

<ul>
<li>The majority of the content is free. Most of Cassey&rsquo;s videos are up on YouTube.</li>
<li>Subscribing to her newsletter gives you access to unique monthly workout plans.</li>
<li>There is an app, however you have to pay for her calendars but her recipes and videos are all free.</li>
<li>As far as I know, pilates is all bodyweight exercises so absolutely no equipment is needed for her videos.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://scattered.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/blogilates-beginners-calender-2.png" rel="attachment wp-att-11076"><img src="http://scattered.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/blogilates-beginners-calender-2-1024x806.png" alt="blogilates-beginners-calender-2" width="1024" height="806" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11076" srcset="http://erzadel.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/blogilates-beginners-calender-2-1024x806.png 1024w, http://erzadel.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/blogilates-beginners-calender-2-300x236.png 300w, http://erzadel.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/blogilates-beginners-calender-2-768x604.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>

<h3 id="day-1-total-body-workout">Day 1: Total Body Workout</h3>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<p>Cassey starts off the video with some breathing techniques, for the absolute beginners to pilates (AKA me). She then goes into the following exercises:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Pilates stance:</em> This is one of the easier ones although my neck kinda hurt a little.</li>
<li><em>Roll ups:</em> Apparently one roll up is equivalent to six crunches and Cassey makes you do around four of these. I struggled with doing this properly as I really do not have the strength to lift myself up from a lying position without any support. I found this one kind of fun though.</li>
<li><em>Leg stuff:</em> Okay, this part was grueling! I have a tendency to painfully cramp in my legs, so I admit I did this section half-heartedly because it felt like I was constantly on the cusp of cramping up. Maybe that&rsquo;s just the nature of the workout but hopefully it improves soon. However, some of the moves are really graceful in this one and I really admired how pretty it looked (when Cassey did it).</li>
<li><em>Cobra position:</em> These moves were like something I&rsquo;d expect from yoga.</li>
<li><em>Elbow push ups:</em> I hate push ups with a dying passion but these were not that bad. Granted, I did do the knee variant. My knees also hurt afterward.</li>
<li><em>Mermaid stretches:</em> These are rather interesting. Although, I feel like I did them wrong because I didn&rsquo;t feel a lot of stretching going on.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>Man, I&rsquo;m out of shape. I didn&rsquo;t do a lot of these exercises 100% as I&rsquo;m not used to physical activity like this. However, Cassey can be really encouraging and she does offer tips on how to ease up on the difficulty if you&rsquo;re having trouble.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen some people complain about Cassey&rsquo;s perkiness but I have nothing to complain about, yet. Sometimes I felt like dying and Cassey would say something like, &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t nothing yet!&rdquo; and I found it kind of motivating. But we&rsquo;ll see as time goes on. I did like how Cassey would tell stories, as it (kind of) takes your mind off the fact that you feel like you&rsquo;re dying.</p>

<p>Overall, I feel sore all over but I feel really happy to have day one over and done with! Starting is always the hardest part so just getting through the first little bit is always a struggle. I&rsquo;ve read that it only gets harder from here on in but I&rsquo;m hoping that I&rsquo;ll be able to stick through with it all.</p>
