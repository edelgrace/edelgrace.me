          <p><p>In an attempt to do more things in my free time, I decided to join a gym. My original plan was to go to my university gym however since I am on co-op, I no longer have the discounted membership included in my tuition. Instead, I opted for my local Fit4Less. It is an extremely more convenient location, significantly cheaper, and a good &ldquo;introductory&rdquo; gym for those who are just starting out. An added bonus was having a friend who had a membership at the same gym so I had a gym buddy!</p>

<p>Today was my first day working out with him. He was a little late so I walked on a treadmill for around fifteen minutes. Once he arrived, we got on another cardio machine. I don&rsquo;t really know the name but we spent a good 30 minutes there talking about how life was going. I got a little out of breath but not really so maybe we weren&rsquo;t doing it right.</p>

<p>Afterwards we went on the lateral row machine. I could only do three sets of ten with 50lbs. A little concerning but I&rsquo;m really weak and I guess you gotta start somewhere!</p>

<p>It was just a quick session because it was getting late and the roads were pretty bad (half the office was working from home today). My mom was worried so we went home. It was a good solid hour spent there and we got to use the massage chairs at the end.</p>

<p>Hopefully we continue going!</p>

          <p><p><strong>The Game</strong></p>

<p>Take turns to ice an object or living being onto a cookie. Everyone guesses what that person iced onto the cookie. There are no winners, just a bunch of people having fun and joking around about their lack of (or possession of) artistic ability.</p>

<p><strong>The Background</strong></p>

<p>Over the holidays I was baking brownies and cookies with my cousins. The brownies had left over frosting so we decided to ice the cookies with cool designs. I attempted to ice a snowflake onto my cookie and my cousin asked me incredulously what the heck was I doing. When I told him that I was frosting a snowflake, he laughed and wanted to try to ice something as well. It quickly turned into a game where we tried to guess what each other made.</p>

<p>The challenge was the fact that the cookies melted the frosting, the frosting was runny, and we weren&rsquo;t professional cookie decorators. Nevertheless, it was a fun little baking session and there was a lot of laughs!</figure></p>

<p><strong>Our Cookies</strong></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what we came up with. In case you can&rsquo;t figure it out, here&rsquo;s a legend (left to right, top to bottom): test (AKA nothing), test, snowflake, wreath, baby Jesus, present, candles, Santa hat, manger, sleigh, Christmas tree, bell, glass of milk, candy cane, holly, Santa, snowman, star, angel, elf, stocking, poinsettia, fireplace, cookies.<figure></p>

          <p><p>The holidays are officially over, for I went back to work today. It was a bit of a slow day. I got my internship extended, however they basically treated me as a new hire since my contract ended in December. So I&rsquo;m starting from scratch, essentially. I had no laptop, no e-mail, no account to login into any computer connected to the company&rsquo;s network&#8230; Kinda rough.</p>

<p>However, I did manage to do some small tasks that didn&rsquo;t require the use of a computer.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently doing an inventory of our gear and before I left for holidays, I was labelling items that needed to be recycled or sold. Apparently some of the labels fell off so I reinforced them all with tape. Since I was gone for two weeks, there were a couple of new devices in our inventory so I took note of those as well.</p>

<p>Some of the devices are strewn about the place with no order so I attempted to move some of them into groups of device types. For example, some of the supervisor engines were mixed with the switches when there was a shelf dedicated solely for engines.</p>

<p>We use bins to store smaller items. Some of the bins didn&rsquo;t have any labels so I had to make some in order for people to know where everything is. I also labelled some ambiguos boxes. It&rsquo;s a big guessing game looking at them all.</p>

<p>I received a package from Meraki containing a Meraki access point. Pretty cool! I thought that maybe I needed to do something with it for work so I read the manual but it turned out that it&rsquo;s mine to keep. It&rsquo;s super sleek.</p>

<p>In my co-op, I have to hand in reports in order to get credit. One of the first things I have to hand in during the start of the work term is learning objectives. I spent a good amount of time trying to think up of what I wanted to accomplish during this work term. I&rsquo;m still pretty undecided as I don&rsquo;t want to repeat myself from last term&rsquo;s objectives.</p>

<p>After work, I went over to my SO&rsquo;s place. While he played Vermintide with friends, I continued reading <em>Buried in Books</em> by Julie Rugg. Basically it&rsquo;s a collection of quotes regarding books and reading. I love reading books about books and reading. What Ilove more is reading a book about books that are about books and reading.</p>

<p>After that we settled in for some quiet time to work on a puzzle I bought him for Christmas. It&rsquo;s a big 1000 piece puzzle of a volcano. I chose it because it was cool and dramatic and it was more than two colours. I guess some people like the challenge of putting together a puzzle of the ocean and the sky but not us.</p>

<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s my day in a nutshell. A very chill and relaxing day. Now I&rsquo;m hoping to tinker with the access point I received, work out a little, and study a bit for my CCNA before I hit the hay.</p>

          <p><p>New Years Resolutions are no longer the in thing. I recently turned 22 and it feels like my life is whizzing by now. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about my goals but there are just too many that I have for one year and a couple that will go beyond 2017. So I figured a 25 before 25 would be appropriate.</p>

<p><strong>1. Graduate from university</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been in university since I was 17. Five years later and I&rsquo;m still here. While I do love the academic environment, I seriously can&rsquo;t wait to graduate. It&rsquo;s about time that I move on from school, even if it&rsquo;s a little scary.</p>

<p><strong>2. Move out of my parents&rsquo; house</strong></p>

<p>It was only until recently that I resolved to move out and move out for good. When I was young, I happily accepted the fact that my parents would like to live with me in their retirement. Not anymore. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about myself and my boundaries towards my parents. I think it would be best for all of us for me to move out.</p>

<p><strong>3. Max out my TFSA</strong></p>

<p>One of the biggest steps towards responsible personal finance is maxing out my tax free savings account. As of 2016, my total contribution limit is around 30k. As the years go by, that will only increase. Hopefully I can do it.</p>

<p><strong>4. Open a RRSP account</strong></p>

<p>The only reason why I don&rsquo;t have one yet is because I don&rsquo;t have a permanent job yet. I simply don&rsquo;t make enough to warrant an RRSP. However, if I want to retire gracefully, an RRSP is essential.</p>

<p><strong>5. Get a full time job in my field</strong></p>

<p>Every graduates worst nightmare is to leave university only to land a part time job at the grocery store. I&rsquo;m hoping to land a job in networking or program development. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be right away, I can stand working retail for a couple of months.</p>

<p><strong>6. Read 150 books/50 books per year</strong></p>

<p>Every year I want to read at least 50 books. I&rsquo;m an avid reader. This year I managed to make it work so I&rsquo;m hoping I can continue to make it work for the next couple of years.</p>

<p><strong>7. Finish the Dragon Age series</strong></p>

<p>One of my friends joke that I&rsquo;ve been playing the first installation of Dragon Age for years. So far I&rsquo;ve clocked around 100 hours and I&rsquo;m definitely nowhere near done it yet. It&rsquo;s those side quests that sidetrack me, I swear.</p>

<p><strong>8. Make my own TCG</strong></p>

<p>A couple of years ago I started working on a TCG but it fell through the cracks. I&rsquo;d love to take up that project again and finish it. I love TCGs so it would be a fun endeavor.</p>

<p><strong>9. Finish my Pomodoro app project</strong></p>

<p>Yesterday I started making a small Pomodoro app. I&rsquo;m making decent progress but it&rsquo;s nowhere near polished. It would be great to finish it.</p>

<p><strong>10. Make a book review website</strong></p>

<p>Another project that I&rsquo;ve been working on for a while. I keep starting and restarting it. I don&rsquo;t want to rely on GoodReads and I fancy the idea of having a local copy of the books I&rsquo;ve read.</p>

<p><strong>11. Get my driver&rsquo;s license</strong></p>

<p>22 and without a license. I feel like a burden asking my friends for rides everywhere. I do like walking around everywhere because I desperately need the exercise. However, the city I live in is not really commuter friendly so a car would make things extremely easier.</p>

<p><strong>12. Make friends outside of the tech bubble</strong></p>

<p>Many of my friends are alike in that we are all tech geeks. From gaming to building PCs to programming, you name it. I think it would be nice to make friends who aren&rsquo;t necessarily into the whole tech thing. Different perspectives is essential for a well-rounded world view. Plus, I&rsquo;d like to be introduced into something that isn&rsquo;t, well, tech.</p>

<p><strong>13. Get fit</strong></p>

<p>I envy those who can lift and run and be athletic. I&rsquo;d really love to lose some weight, cut down on the body fat, and not be struggling for air after walking three flights of stairs.</p>

<p><strong>14. Floss more regularly</strong></p>

<p>My dentist always begs me to floss but no matter how many horror stories she gives me, I just don&rsquo;t do it. I know I should. I really have to.</p>

<p><strong>15. Drink. More. Water.</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m dehydrated <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>. I&rsquo;m convinced that I have years shaved off my life purely due to the fact that I do not drink enough water. I don&rsquo;t notice my thirst cues very well until my head is throbbing, my lips a cracked, and my throat is parched. Dangerous.</p>

<p><strong>16. Learn how to actually cook</strong></p>

<p>If I want to move out, I should probably learn how to cook. And not just making sandwiches. I&rsquo;d love to be able to make pasta.</p>

<p><strong>17. Travel internationally without family</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve traveled to another country without family once but it was a school field trip. I would love to go to Japan but that&rsquo;s expensive. Maybe I&rsquo;ll just cross the border down south again?</p>

<p><strong>18. Konmari ALL of my things</strong></p>

<p>I started the Konmari process but have yet to progress past my books. It would be beneficial to accomplish this before I move out. Less stuff to pack!</p>

<p><strong>19. Get drunk for the first time</strong></p>

<p>I had my first alcoholic beverage this year. I&rsquo;ve never been black out drunk before and I think there should be a first time for everything. Hopefully I don&rsquo;t spiral from there.</p>

<p><strong>20. Get my CCNA certification</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m about halfway through my CCNA course so getting my CCNA is totally on the horizon.</p>

<p><strong>21. Attend Zoo Lights</strong></p>

<p>Zoo Lights is a local festival that happens every winter. I&rsquo;ve never gone before because my parents have been paranoid about my being out in the cold at night. I think it would make for a good future date.</p>

<p><strong>22. Get a grasp on my depression</strong></p>

<p>Oof, it got heavy suddenly. I&rsquo;ve been struggling with depression for a couple of years now. I think I&rsquo;ve identified some sources and I&rsquo;d like to come up with a plan to combat it.</p>

<p><strong>23. Continue my pen pal relationships</strong></p>

<p>I have a pen pal whom I haven&rsquo;t written to in months. Well, I sent him a quick Christmas card but that doesn&rsquo;t count in my opinion. I&rsquo;d love to pick up the pen again as I do miss his correspondences!</p>

<p><strong>24. Go to a concert</strong></p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t been to a concert since my very first concert (My Chemical Romance, RIP). I have a couple of bands and artists that I&rsquo;d love to see live but it&rsquo;s just a matter of if they come to Calgary! But it would totally be cool to take a road trip outside of the city to watch some live music.</p>

<p><strong>25. Make a dent in my to-watch movie list</strong></p>

<p>There are too many movies that I have not seen before. Just to name a few: V for Vendetta, Clueless, Pulp Fiction, Schindler&rsquo;s List, Singing in the Rain, Princess Mononoke, Gone Girl, Akira, The Princess Bride&#8230;</p>
