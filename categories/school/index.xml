      <description>I went back to school today. It&amp;rsquo;s a little weird to be back at school but also familiar. This semester is going to be a light one. I&amp;rsquo;m only taking two courses. One course is only five days long. So essentially I just have one course throughout the semester!
The block week course I&amp;rsquo;m taking right now is just a history course but it&amp;rsquo;s really interesting. I&amp;rsquo;ve always found history fascinating but I was never great at being tested on or writing about history.</description>
