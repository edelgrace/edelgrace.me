              </ul>
          </div>

          <p><p>I recently started learning how to use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">emacs</a>, which is a text editor and a Lisp interpreter. During my quest for resources, I came across a number of developers and their blogs. Since I&rsquo;m always intrigued by what sort of tools developers use to make their blogs, I did a little snooping. A shocking number of people who didn&rsquo;t use WordPress as their blogging platform opted for flat files instead.</p>

<p>Now I had dabbled a little bit in static pages before with <a href="https://www.boltwire.com/">BoltWire</a> but ultimately abandoned it to go back to WordPress. I think where I went wrong with BoltWire was that it simply did not have a big enough community (although they are an extremely dedicated community) to keep me reassured that I had made the right choice.</p>

<p>However, I know flat files in general is a real and upcoming thing. Since I&rsquo;m planning to use emacs and Markdown files as my main way of documenting things, it would be easy to use it in my blogging as well.</p>

<p>So my main reasons for switching to a flat file system:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Better security</strong><br />
WordPress was giving me so much trouble when it came to security. Yes, Jetpack did help in reducing spam and MySQL doesn&rsquo;t randomly stop working anymore but you have to admit that using WordPress on a Digital Ocean server makes you a target.</li></p></li>

<li><p><strong>Version control</strong><br />
Yes, WordPress does have versioning for content however it would be much easier to have version control for settings, themes, etc. over the WordPress kind.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Less bloat</strong><br />
I don&rsquo;t need everything that WordPress offers and honestly sometimes I feel like it might be a bit overkill. Since the server I&rsquo;m on has limited RAM and disk space, I need to be careful about the amount of resources I use. It helps that I don&rsquo;t have many visitors to begin with but still!</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Faster loading times</strong><br />
While I&rsquo;m unsure if this is too much of a concern for me but loading times do make me a bit worried. Fetching from a database can be quite slow.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>I want a more future proof blogging system</strong><br />
There are options to export your content into XML files in WordPress however it can&rsquo;t beat readable Markdown, which many static file systems use. The fact that everything is file based is future proof in itself. Migrating from one server to the other wouldn&rsquo;t be too much hard work.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>My concerns:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What comment system to use</strong><br />
I do not like Disqus. I dislike the fact that I have to register for yet another site and people can&rsquo;t click on my name on a comment and go directly to my website. I also don&rsquo;t like the fact that the comments don&rsquo;t stay on my server. I want to be able to have my comments.</li>
<li><strong>Learning curve</strong><br />
This would be a little more technically involved at first to get everything installed, just due to the nature of it not being a one-click install.</li>
<li><strong>So many choices!</strong><br />
There is no shortage of flat file systems out there. Like I&rsquo;ve said, I&rsquo;ve dabbled in BoltWire before and wiki systems but it&rsquo;s so hard to find one that will work for you when there&rsquo;s a breadth of options.</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the main frameworks I&rsquo;ve been looking at is <a href="http://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> which is used by <a href="https://baty.net/">Baty.net</a>, <a href="http://www.modernemacs.com">Modern Emacs</a>, <a href="https://kieranhealy.org">kieranHealy.org</a>, <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog">but she&rsquo;s a girl&#8230;</a>, and more. I am very attracted to this option because it seems like it could work pretty well with an emacs workflow.</p>

<p>Thankfully, I finally recovered my previous website, <a href="http://erzadel.net">erzadel.net</a> and now have access to my old blog posts. I&rsquo;ll be tinkering with that this weekend and try to have a clone of my old blog up and running on my local machine. We&rsquo;ll see how it goes!</p>

          </div>

          <p><p>The past couple of weeks I noticed that the MySQL service on my server would routinely stop out of the blue. At first I suspected that it was because my 512MB RAM wasn&rsquo;t enough but when I looked at the usage history, I never peaked more than 9%. I even tried reinstalling the MySQL server which worked at first but then it stopped running again.</p>

<p>However, I think the problem was due to bots trying to log into my WordPress dashboard. One thread I was reading suggested xmlrpc attacks were bringing WordPress down. When I looked at my logs, there was a dozen of attempted logins.</p>

<p>There are multiple solutions for this, mainly blocling xmlrpc but since I use third party apps that rely on xmlrpc, I didn&rsquo;t want to block it entirely. Jetpack was another solution which is what I eventually opted for.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been wary of installing Jetpack, mostly due to the fact my server is not that great and I was worried about space and memory consumption. However, it does have a feature to block malicious xmlrpc login attempts that I desparately needed.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s only been two days now (as of writing this) and I already see that Jetpack has blocked over 25 login attempts. Now this doesn&rsquo;t protect me from other attacks and on other sites on this server but at leaat I have that out of the way.</p>

          <h4>Jan 7, 2017 | <a href="http://edelgrace.me/websites/phew-i-moved-my-fanlistings/#disqus_thread">Comments</a></h4>
          
          <div class="tags">
              <ul>
                
                <li><a href="/categories/websites">Websites</a></li>            
                
    
                
                <li><a href="/tags/fanlistings">#fanlistings</a></li>
                
              </ul>
          </div>

          <p><p>Fanlistings are basically the early 2000&rsquo;s version of Facebook pages. I <a href="http://fan.edelgrace.me">own a bunch of them</a>, mostly of songs or video game characters. Honestly, the whole fanlisting thing has been going down in popularity as the years go by. It&rsquo;s a bit sad. Fanlistings come and go a lot. There&rsquo;s a high turnover rate. I try my best to maintain and keep mine up and running.</p>

<p>However, my old domain name expired and I had trouble getting in touch with my registrar to renew it. I really loved that domain name because it featured my frequently used user handle but I determined it to be a lost cause and ultimately let it go. Since GitHub introduced the student pack which included a .me domain for free for one year, I claimed it. Hence, <em>edelgrace.me</em> was born.</p>

<p>Right now I&rsquo;m using $50 credit from <a href="https://m.do.co/c/999dd787b62c">Digital Ocean</a> (yes, that is a referral link) for an Ubuntu droplet. However, it only runs on 512MB RAM so I opted to buy a cheap 1GB RAM server from <a href="http://ramnode.com">RamNode</a> (no, that is actually not a referral link). 512MB RAM would probably be enough for me since I don&rsquo;t receive many visits to my websites but you never know what the future might bring.</p>

<p>So on the event of my domain expiring, I moved all of my fanlistings over to the RamNode server. I exported a SQL file through phpMyAdmin from my website to recreate the database and ran it on the server. Since I wanted better naming conventions, I had to change all the config files in order to connect to the database. There were some issues that I had to plow through in Enthusiast, one being that the absolute path to the fanlisting script needed to be changed. Since I&rsquo;m no longer of thinking of sticking to hosting but rather maintaining my own servers, I don&rsquo;t think I should have to worry about changing the path ever again.</p>

<p>Afterwards, I had to contact <a href="http://thefanlistings.org">The Fanlisting Network</a> (TFL) in order to change my URLs. The network is to ensure that duplicate fanlistings don&rsquo;t exist. In theory, duplicate fanlistings can exist but the ones listed on TFL are more trusted.</p>

<p>In summary, that was my evening last night. It took up more time than I wanted but that&rsquo;s okay. I still managed to get some studying for CCNA done so all went well.</p>
