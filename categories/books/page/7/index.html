<p>Is everyday a reading day for you? Submitted by Elizabeth @ <a href="​http://silversolara.blogspot.com/">Silver&rsquo;s Reviews</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m trying to make it a habit of reading everyday. Realistically though, I only really read during the work week. Those days I specifically block out times for myself dedicated for reading: on the way to and from work (since I take public transportation). One day I&rsquo;d like to read everyday, but I still have a way to go.</p>

<p>Where&rsquo;s your favourite place to read? Submitted by Ronyell @ <a href="http://rabbitearsbookblog.blogspot.com/">Rabbit Ears Book Blog</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I will be honest&#8230; I don&rsquo;t think I have a favourite place, as long as I&rsquo;m reading. In terms of places where I usually read is on the bus or when I&rsquo;m eating. I wish I had a better place to read, it&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve sat down in a dedicated spot for reading at home.</p>

          <p><p>The holidays are officially over, for I went back to work today. It was a bit of a slow day. I got my internship extended, however they basically treated me as a new hire since my contract ended in December. So I&rsquo;m starting from scratch, essentially. I had no laptop, no e-mail, no account to login into any computer connected to the company&rsquo;s network&#8230; Kinda rough.</p>

<p>However, I did manage to do some small tasks that didn&rsquo;t require the use of a computer.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently doing an inventory of our gear and before I left for holidays, I was labelling items that needed to be recycled or sold. Apparently some of the labels fell off so I reinforced them all with tape. Since I was gone for two weeks, there were a couple of new devices in our inventory so I took note of those as well.</p>

<p>Some of the devices are strewn about the place with no order so I attempted to move some of them into groups of device types. For example, some of the supervisor engines were mixed with the switches when there was a shelf dedicated solely for engines.</p>

<p>We use bins to store smaller items. Some of the bins didn&rsquo;t have any labels so I had to make some in order for people to know where everything is. I also labelled some ambiguos boxes. It&rsquo;s a big guessing game looking at them all.</p>

<p>I received a package from Meraki containing a Meraki access point. Pretty cool! I thought that maybe I needed to do something with it for work so I read the manual but it turned out that it&rsquo;s mine to keep. It&rsquo;s super sleek.</p>

<p>In my co-op, I have to hand in reports in order to get credit. One of the first things I have to hand in during the start of the work term is learning objectives. I spent a good amount of time trying to think up of what I wanted to accomplish during this work term. I&rsquo;m still pretty undecided as I don&rsquo;t want to repeat myself from last term&rsquo;s objectives.</p>

<p>After work, I went over to my SO&rsquo;s place. While he played Vermintide with friends, I continued reading <em>Buried in Books</em> by Julie Rugg. Basically it&rsquo;s a collection of quotes regarding books and reading. I love reading books about books and reading. What Ilove more is reading a book about books that are about books and reading.</p>

<p>After that we settled in for some quiet time to work on a puzzle I bought him for Christmas. It&rsquo;s a big 1000 piece puzzle of a volcano. I chose it because it was cool and dramatic and it was more than two colours. I guess some people like the challenge of putting together a puzzle of the ocean and the sky but not us.</p>

<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s my day in a nutshell. A very chill and relaxing day. Now I&rsquo;m hoping to tinker with the access point I received, work out a little, and study a bit for my CCNA before I hit the hay.</p>

          <p><p>This year I told myself I would read at least 25 books. It doesn&rsquo;t seem like a lot but when you consider my reading history the past couple of years, that&rsquo;s a big number.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>2015</strong>: 7 books + 3 graphic novels = 10 books</li>
<li><strong>2014</strong>: 19 books + 20 graphic novels = 39 books</li>
<li><strong>2013</strong>: 40 books + 30 graphic novels = 74 books</li>
<li><strong>2012</strong>: 18 books</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, not great numbers. Each year I have been reading less and less. 2013 was a weird anomaly. So far this year of 2016 (there&rsquo;s still like ten days left in the year&#8230;) I only managed to read 38 books, not including graphic novels. In total I&rsquo;ve read about 84 books. So that&rsquo;s still like 46 graphic novels that I&rsquo;ve read. I really wanted my novel to graphic novel ratio to be greater than or equal to one. However, I still met my goal of 25 books. So kudos to me!</p>

<p>This year I decided to opt for minimalism and not sign up for any reading challenges. To me, the most important thing is going through my to read list. If I even manage to make a small dent in the list, I&rsquo;ll be happy.</p>

<p><strong>Here are my 2017 reading resoltuions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Read a total of 60 books.</li>
<li>Read at least 30 non-graphic novels.</li>
<li>Read more novels than graphic novels.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t take out any books from the library that are not in my to read list.</li>
<li>Read at least half of the books on my 25 books to read in 2017 list</li>
</ul>

          </div>

          <p><p>I recently made a trip to the library. Here&rsquo;s what I managed to grab.</p>

<p><strong>Buried in Books: A Reader&rsquo;s Anthology by Julie Rugg</strong><br />
There are quite a lot of books on my to-read list that I don&rsquo;t recall exactly why they&rsquo;re on the list. But I trust myself if a book is on the list. I actually culled off the more obvious ones but the ones that stayed are ones that really interest me. I like reading about reading, a little ironic but it&rsquo;s interesting to see how others view reading.</p>

<p><strong>Madame Tussaud by Michelle Moran</strong><br />
Yet another unknown. I think this is due to the fact that it is historical fiction involving royalty during the French Revolution.</p>

<p><strong>The Midwich Cuckoos by Jogn Wyndham</strong><br />
I&rsquo;ve been trying to get into science fiction. I adored the sci-fi and fantasy genres when I was younger. I don&rsquo;t quite know what happened to my preferences. I think I got all sappy and romantic but there&rsquo;s no reason why science fiction can&rsquo;t be romantic!</p>

<p><strong>Something New by Lucy Kinsley</strong><br />
Kinsley&rsquo;s previous works were pretty good and I think her drawings are cute and quirky. I love the autobiographical element.</p>

<p><strong>Two Kisses for Maddy by Matthew Logelin</strong><br />
I always try to get some non-fiction into my library trips. My go to is always memoirs. I have yet to read a memoir involving children. Good luck. I do not predict dry eyes for this one.</p>

<p><strong>You Can Act on Camera by D.W. Brown</strong><br />
This one wasn&rsquo;t on any list but I justified it because it was such a slim volume. Seems interesting. I think the book title is lying but we&rsquo;ll see how Brown defends his claim.</p>
