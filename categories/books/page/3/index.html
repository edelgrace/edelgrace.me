<blockquote>
<p>When you feature a book in your posts, do you include a book cover?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I definitely try my best to do so. It seems a little weird to write a blog post about a book without featuring the cover. I know most people like visuals when they look at a post and feel more enticed to read it. They also say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t judge a book by it&rsquo;s cover&rdquo; but more often than not, I&rsquo;m sure many people do (I am one of them!) and decide to pass on posts depending on what kind of book they think it is about just from the cover. This might have the opposite effect from what a blogger may want but it just seems to be the standard!</p>

<p>If you could meet one author, dead or alive, who would it be? Submitted by Kristin @ <a href="http://luktenavtrykksverte.blogspot.no/">Lukten av Trykksverte</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am in love with the Brontë sisters. Their lives intrigue me a great deal and the sense of mystery surrounding them is too much for me to take at times. There are days when I spend hours researching and reading about their lives, despite most of the information being repeated.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me to pick just one of the sisters but I just might have to choose Charlotte. I admire her works the most. Maybe it&rsquo;s because she published the most books out of her sisters that I prefer he works. That doesn&rsquo;t absolve the fact that I also would love to pick at her brain and learn about her life.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not even sure what I would ask. I just would love to be in the prescence of an incredibly creative mind. She has led a romantic life that I almost envy. Yes, I envy tragically romantic lives such as hers.</p>

<p>But I think the day should be spent in her beloved moorlands. A picnic, if possible. We&rsquo;d eat and drink while looking out on the desolate land. Maybe we&rsquo;d talk about her childhood, the stories that she never managed to write, her sisters and her brother, or the regrets she has had in her life. Or maybe we&rsquo;d just sit in silence and take in the view.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For more than four decades, Ursula K. Le Guin has enthralled readers with her imagination, clarity, and moral vision. The recipient of numerous literary prizes, including the National Book Award, the Kafka Award, and five Hugo and five Nebula Awards, this renowned writer has, in each story and novel, created a provocative, ever-evolving universe filled with diverse worlds and rich characters reminiscent of our earthly selves.</p>

<p>Now, in <em>The Birthday of the World</em>, this gifted artist returns to these worlds in eight brilliant short works, including a never-before-published novella, each of which probes the essence of humanity. Here are stories that explore complex social interactions and troublesome issues of gender and sex; that define and defy notions of personal relationships and of society itself; that examine loyalty, survival, and introversion; that bring to light the vicissitudes of slavery and the meaning of transformation, religion, and history.</p>

<p>The first six tales in this spectacular volume are set in the author&rsquo;s signature world of the Ekumen, &ldquo;my pseudo-coherent universe with holes in the elbows,&rdquo; as Le Guin describes it — a world made familiar in her award-winning novel The Left Hand of Darkness. The seventh, title story was hailed by Publishers Weekly as &ldquo;remarkable &hellip; a standout.&rdquo; The final offering in the collection, Paradises Lost, is a mesmerizing novella of space exploration and the pursuit of happiness.In her foreword, Ursula K. Le Guin writes, &ldquo;to create difference-to establish strangeness-then to let the fiery arc of human emotion leap and close the gap: this acrobatics of the imagination fascinates and satisfies me as noother.&rdquo; In <em>The Birthday of the World</em>, this gifted literary acrobat exhibits a dazzling array of skills that will fascinate and satisfy us all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have found a new favourite author in Ursula K. Le Guin. I first read her work, &ldquo;A Fisherman of the Inland Sea&rdquo; which piqued my curiosity and I kept searching for her books until now. &ldquo;The Birthday of the World and Other Stories&rdquo; is not so different from the book I first read by this author. They are both collections of short stories and even feature some of the same planets. Somehow, I did not tire of the universe that Le Guin has created. There was always something new to learn about a planet or a species, even if I had already read about them before.</p>

<p>While her universe isn&rsquo;t as carefully crafted as one would think (her prologue discusses this), there is no denying the fact that her universe is extremely immersive. I could get lost in the lore and the people in it. Her characters, although many of them alien, are very understandable. Though their customs may be different, it was still generally easy to empathize with their specific alien problems. Everything is so believable and feels very real. Not once was I pulled out of my suspense of belief.</p>

<p>The stories were very memorable as well. Each culture was so distinct that I found it hard to mix up stories. I will admit that some of my favourite stories are the ones about the people of O and their complex relationship structures. However, my favourite story from this collection is without a doubt the very last story.</p>

<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m being a little bit egocentric because it&rsquo;s a story about us humans directly but I found it to be a very touching experience. I envy future generations who get to travel through space and I am always in awe of future generations learning about the past and how they would think of our current ways of thinking. Still, there&rsquo;s a relationship element in addition to all the nitty gritty sci fi that made my eyes water towards the end.</p>

<p>All in all, I would travel in Ursula K. le Guin&rsquo;s universes again. Her worlds are a world builders wet dream. Thank goodness I have found Ursula K. le Guin.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have been awakened.</p>

<p>Floppy disk inserted, computer turned on, a whirring, and then this sentence, followed by a blinking cursor. So begins Suspended, the first computer game to obsess seven-year-old Michael, to worm into his head and change his sense of reality. Thirty years later he will write: &ldquo;Computer games have taught me the things you can&rsquo;t learn from people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gamelife is the memoir of a childhood transformed by technology. Afternoons spent gazing at pixelated maps and mazes train Michael&rsquo;s eyes for the uncanny side of 1980s suburban Illinois. A game about pirates yields clues to the drama of cafeteria politics and locker-room hazing. And in the year of his parents&rsquo; divorce, a spaceflight simulator opens a hole in reality.</p>

<p>In telling the story of his youth through seven computer games, Michael W. Clune captures the part of childhood we live alone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m always intrigued about what people have to say about video games. What I find even more intriguing is how video games impact people&rsquo;s lives. More often than not, most video game memoirs (that I have read) involve the awkward geek entering into the beginning of the video game era. They find themselves or find a way out of themselves with this exciting new piece of technology by playing their way through <em>Wolfenstein</em>, <em>Doom</em>, <em>Ultima</em>, <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Michael Clune&rsquo;s <em>Gamelife</em> is no exception to this template. What unique offerings he has are in the form of metaphors and a somewhat serious video game addiction. At times, it feels like Clune&rsquo;s metaphors and observations are a bit of a stretch. It&rsquo;s almost like he tries to find meaning in something that doesn&rsquo;t have any meaning at all (i.e. <sky quote>). Other times, he&rsquo;s awfully poetic.</p>

<p>There were points where I assumed the role of his mother. I, too, worried about Clune&rsquo;s empty social life. But I also knew too well the unreasonably cruel ways that kids operated.</p>

<p>Okay, I didn&rsquo;t really. I had a good group of friends that I grew up with. However, I never felt as inside of the group as I thought I should be. Like Michael, I saw my friends faces close off mid-laugh and their eyes suddenly go distant the moment I opened my mouth.</p>

<p>I, also like Michael, retreated into the world of video games but of the much milder sort. My addiction was Runescape and Club Penguin. I&rsquo;d build endless camp fires, bake bread, and pretend to be a penguin spy. I wasn&rsquo;t like Clune&rsquo;s classmate Evan, who was true to himself no matter what character appeared on his screen. Even when I did name a character after myself, I always played as the person who I used to be.</p>

<p>It was observations like these, the ones where I found myself in them, that made me really appreciate this book. However there was something about Clune&rsquo;s style of narration that didn&rsquo;t jive with me. Perhaps, I disliked Clune&rsquo;s portrayal of himself. There was no redemption moment for Clune and no real moments of growth.</p>

<p>Would I recommend this to someone? Yeah, I think it has value. The main reason why I didn&rsquo;t enjoy this as much as I could have is probably a matter of preference.</p>
