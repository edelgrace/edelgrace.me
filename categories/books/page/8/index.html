          <p>

<p>On Goodreads, my &ldquo;want-to-own&rdquo; shelf used to have 127 books in it. Now it has five.</p>

<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been bit by the konmari bug. I&rsquo;ve konmari&rsquo;d my wardrobe and my books so far. I&rsquo;m still stuck on the books. I decided it would be fitting to prevent my book collection from growing back to it&rsquo;s ridiculous size and get rid of anything that doesn&rsquo;t spark joy on my book wish list.</p>

<h3 id="books-that-made-the-cut">Books that made the cut</h3>

<p><strong>The Last Unicorn by Peter S. Beagle</strong><br />
I read this book a couple of years ago. Although it&rsquo;s aimed at a younger audience, I really enjoyed this story. After reading it, I went to watch the animated movie as well. A small part of me has always been fascinated by unicorns and horses (I blame Sailor Moon as the source of that).</p>

<p><strong>The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde</strong><br />
To be honest, I don&rsquo;t remember much of this book but I do remember being in awe of Wilde&rsquo;s writing. I remember the last few pages more than anything. It was not exactly terrifying but it was a bit&#8230; Grotesque? I mostly want this book so I can re-read it.</p>

<p><strong>The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov</strong><br />
A couple of years ago I took a Russian Literature course and had to do a group presentation on this book. This book is probably one of the very few that I actually read front to back for a class. Actually, I read all the required books in this course. That was a first for me. Bulgakov&rsquo;s imagination is borderline execessive with this work but I do like his alternative history spin on Jesus&rsquo; life.</p>

<p><strong>The Glass Menagerie by Tenesee Williams</strong><br />
Marie Kondo&rsquo;s motto is to get rid of anything that doesn&rsquo;t spark joy. This play is incredibly sad but in a way, it also sparks joy for me. I find it to be such a heartbreakingly simple story that I can&rsquo;t help but appreciate it.</p>

<p><strong>Sabriel by Garth Nix</strong><br />
When I was younger, I was totally absorbed in fantasy. I don&rsquo;t know what happened, I hardly ever read any of the fantasy genre anymore. Sabriel really touched something in me. I got sucked into the world. One of my childhood friends recently (as in, like a couple of weeks ago) told me that I reminded her of Sabriel. She was the one who recommended this book to me way back when. That&rsquo;s another thing that I appreciate about this book.</p>

<h3 id="books-that-almost-made-the-cut">Books that almost made the cut</h3>

<p><strong>Paradise Kiss series by Ai Yazawa</strong><br />
Okay, I&rsquo;m still on the fence about this one. I love this series and I love Ai Yazawa&rsquo;s work. Paradise Kiss is one of those series that sat with me for a while. Maybe I&rsquo;ll have to read this one over again and see how I feel about it. The reason why I&rsquo;m not sure is because I feel like there&rsquo;s something unsettling about it. It&rsquo;s a little similar to how I feel about <em>The Glass Menagerie</em>. It&rsquo;s incredibly bittersweet. There are some scenes that I remember that actually make me feel a pang in my chest. I&rsquo;m tearing up right now thinking about it!</p>

<p><strong>A Great and Terrible Beauty by Libba Bray</strong><br />
The Gemma Doyle series is pretty okay but damn, the covers are gorgeous (yes, I&rsquo;m a little shallow). I love the gothic setting and historical aspect of it but unfortunately, it was lacking in content a little. It would be nice to have it sit on my shelf and look pretty but I would never pick it up and read it again.</p>

          <p><p>I recently resolved not to take out any library books unless they were on my to read list. Here&rsquo;s what I took out on my latest trip to the library!</p>

<p><strong>Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson</strong><br />
I don&rsquo;t remember why or how this book got onto my to read list but I know that it&rsquo;s been on the list for quite a while. I was glad to see the book sitting on the shelf since I&rsquo;ve been looking for it.</p>

<p><strong>Sputnik Sweetheart by Haruki Murakami</strong><br />
Pretty much all of Murakami&rsquo;s books are on my to read list. <em>Sputnik Sweetheart</em> is no exception. Usually there are three things I always go check when I go to the library: the manga section, Jodi Picoult, and Haruki Murakami. Murakami is pretty popular so I was lucky I got a hold on this novel.</p>

<p><strong>The Secret Diaries of Charlotte Bronte by Syrie James</strong><br />
I adore the Bronte family and pretty much everything Bronte related, non-fiction or fiction, is on my to read list.</p>

          <h3><a href="http://edelgrace.me/life/reading-the-secret-diaries-of-charlotte-bronte/">Reading: The Secret Diaries of Charlotte Brontë</a></h3>
          <h4>Dec 5, 2016 | <a href="http://edelgrace.me/life/reading-the-secret-diaries-of-charlotte-bronte/#disqus_thread">Comments</a></h4>
          
          <div class="tags">

          <p><p>I&rsquo;m extremely fond of Charlotte Brontë. <em>Villette</em> is easily my favourite novel and I hold it very close to my heart. A couple week ago I finally got around to reading <em>Jane Eyre</em> and it did not disappoint. The other members of the Brontë family are not to be overlooked either. I enjoyed Emily&rsquo;s <em>Wuthering Heights</em> and all of Anne&rsquo;s books are in my to read list. So when I stumbled upon <em>The Secret Diaries of Charlotte Brontë</em> by Syrie James in the library, I couldn&rsquo;t resist picking it up.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s something about the Brontë family that I find incredibly interesting. I&rsquo;m a romantic at heart and the family&rsquo;s strange ability to be surrounded by tragedy is appealing to me. I&rsquo;ve watched documentaries and read numerous articles about them. I&rsquo;ve looked at Branwell&rsquo;s family portrait numerous times and tried to imagine what the Brontë sisters would have looked like. I&rsquo;ve seen George Richmond&rsquo;s chalk sketch of Charlotte and built a picture of Charlotte in my head. I gazed at photos of the moors and wondered at what attracted the family to such a dull place. I envied their love for literature and their eagerness to be absorbed in their fictional worlds. Unfortunately, this all worked against my favour while I began to read <em>The Secret Diaries of Charlotte Brontë</em>.</p>

<p>The first couple of pages were disappointing to me. The book claimed to be written by Charlotte&rsquo;s hand but I (foolishly) despaired at how the style was so unlike Charlotte. Her character in my head did not align with James&rsquo; vision. When I pictured the events, I pictured a woman who was not Charlotte. She was more like Jane Austen&rsquo;s Emma, a beautiful woman with a naive and girlish charm. I could not picture Charlotte&rsquo;s plain face on this Emma. This is not James&rsquo; fault in the slightest. It&rsquo;s my own expectations that ruined it for me.</p>

<p>However, it got better. I eventually came to accept Emma as Charlotte. In a way, I still don&rsquo;t 100% see my Charlotte in the pages. I&rsquo;m not yet half way through the book but I&rsquo;m very engrossed in it. I appreciate all the references and while not entirely in Charlotte&rsquo;s style, it is Charlotte-esque in content. It&rsquo;s hard for it to not reflect any of Charlotte&rsquo;s essence, since much of her work is modelled after her own life and the novel fully appreciates both her work and her life.</p>

<p>So far, I guess you could say that I like it.</p>

          </div>

          <p>

<p>I initially started writing this post in 2012. I&rsquo;ve been going through and cleaning out my drafts and decided this one was worthy of continuing and actually publishing.</p>

<p>Comics are usually written off as being childish or something only nerds can enjoy. But, I&rsquo;m not here to argue whether comics are legitimate literature or not. I&rsquo;m here to point out some of my favourite web comics. I don&rsquo;t know where it started but I got bored one day and eventually ended up on a web comics site. I thought I wasn&rsquo;t one for web comics but eventually, I was hooked.</p>

<h3 id="myth">MYth</h3>

<p><a href="http://myth.smackjeeves.com"><img src="http://scattered.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/myth.jpg" alt="myth" width="468" height="60" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11048" srcset="http://erzadel.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/myth.jpg 468w, http://erzadel.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/myth-300x38.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://myth.smackjeeves.com">MYth</a> by <a href="http://zeldacw">Zelda</a>. I stumbled upon the author&rsquo;s DeviantArt page and eventually ended up on her web comic. I was immediately impressed and in awe.</p>

<p>MYth is a spin off on Greek mythology. It&rsquo;s so good that it received two awards from Tokyopop, one of the major comic book publishers in North America. In MYth, there are multiple story arcs. The arc I last read included Zeus and Hades (typical, right?) in their younger years in a different light than most people would think of. Zelda has such a wonderful interpretation of the two gods and their relationship that it makes the story seem like her own and not taken from myths. It&rsquo;s just an incredible comic.</p>

<h3 id="one-halfed">One Halfed</h3>

<p><a href="http://1halfed.smackjeeves.com"><img src="http://scattered.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/onehalfed.png" alt="one halfed" width="468" height="60" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11050" srcset="http://erzadel.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/onehalfed.png 468w, http://erzadel.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/onehalfed-300x38.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" /></a></p>

<p>On the other side of the spectrum, there&rsquo;s angst-ridden and dramatic slice of life web comic, <a href="http://1halfed.smackjeeves.com">One Halfed</a> by 2die. This comic is absolutely beautiful. The drawings are expressive and just so darn appealing to the eye. Also, you can&rsquo;t ignore the plot. It&rsquo;s mostly character driven so if you&rsquo;re looking for some action packed explosions you&rsquo;re looking in the wrong place. The characterization and the development of the characters are superb which is rare for any kind of literature. Currently, updates are slowly trickling in. The artist was on hiatus for a while but it seems that they are &ldquo;back.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="no-pink-ponies">No Pink Ponies</h3>

<p><a href="http://nopinkponies.keenspot.com"><img src="http://scattered.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/nopinkponies.gif" alt="no pink ponies" width="468" height="60" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11051" /></a></p>

<p>Okay, <a href="http://nopinkponies.keenspot.com">No Pink Ponies</a> hasn&rsquo;t been updated in over a year now. It&rsquo;s incredibly sad but the journey through the comic is worth it. It&rsquo;s sad when an author abandons their work but it&rsquo;s pretty much normal in the web comic world. This comic is very slice of life and a little goofy. It&rsquo;s a lot of fun with the right amount of seriousness. Unfortunately (?) it does play into the whole geeky aspect of comics and such, but I love geek culture so that wasn&rsquo;t an issue for me. I adore the art style. It&rsquo;s very much &ldquo;Western comic&rdquo; to the tee.</p>

<h3 id="crescendo">Crescendo</h3>

<p><a href="http://crescendocomic.smackjeeves.com"><img src="http://scattered.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/crescendo.gif" alt="crescendo" width="468" height="60" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11052" /></a></p>

<p>I really love my slice of life! This one is very centered on romance. The characters can be a little bit one dimensional, fitting perfectly into their stereotypes but overall, they&rsquo;re pretty interesting! Usually you hear about the &ldquo;rich girl&rdquo; and the &ldquo;working class guy&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s nice seeing it &ldquo;switch up.&rdquo; I really enjoy <a href="http://crescendocomic.smackjeeves.com">Crescendo</a>! The art is so pretty and since it&rsquo;s an active comic, I love reading the comments whenever an update comes up.</p>

<p>The great thing about self-publishing comics is that there is so much variety in the range of topics that can be covered from all sorts of different people without restraint. <a href="http://sovcomic.smackjeeves.com">Society of Vice</a> is about a therapy group which includes a couple of LGBTQ+ members. The water colour art style is GORGEOUS! Seriously! Unfortunately, the comic is currently on hiatus last time I checked. The content is pretty mature so read with caution.</p>
