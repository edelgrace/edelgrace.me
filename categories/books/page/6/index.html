<p>Read or Clean? Read or Bake? Read or Make Dinner? What would be your choice? Submitted by Elizabeth @ <a href="http://www.abgtl.co.uk/">Silver&rsquo;s Reviews</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are quite a lot of questions for today!</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Read or Clean?</strong> If I play my cards right, both! Wait, do audiobooks count as &ldquo;reading&rdquo;? If so, then yes. If not, read! I find &ldquo;reading&rdquo; a great way to multitask when I&rsquo;m doing chores, especially when I&rsquo;m folding clothes. I actually want to buy Bluetooth headphones one day so I can vaccum and wash dishes without the hassle of wires.</li>
<li><strong>Read or Bake?</strong> Okay&#8230; I love baking and enjoying the fruits of my labour so for this one, I&rsquo;m going with baking! I find baking very calming. Sometimes you need a hobby that isn&rsquo;t reading!</li>
<li><strong>Read or Make Dinner?</strong> READ!!! I hate making dinner. The difference between baking and making dinner is that baking is definitely a treat and a special ocassion while making dinner is something that I have to do. I also need to pay attention to my cooking so audiobooks aren&rsquo;t a good way to go in this regard.</li>
</ul>

<p>How <strong>many</strong>? As in, a specific number? Too many to count. Actually, that&rsquo;s not accurate. I don&rsquo;t really know the answer to that question. There have been a lot of books that I gave up on. The most recent book was <em>The Rebel</em> by Albert Camus, however I am determined to finish it. A couple of Amy Tan books were hard for me to complete. <em>Cryptonomicon</em> is another one that I&rsquo;ve started and restarted to read over and over again. Yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot&#8230; No way I could list (or count) them all!</p>

<p>What was the one time you thought the movie was better than the book? Submitted by Tomi @ <a href="http://www.abgtl.co.uk/">A Bookworm&rsquo;s Guide to Life</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, this is a really tough one. I am sure I have watched plenty of book movies but I haven&rsquo;t always read the book counterpart. Honestly, the only thing that comes to my mind is probably the <em>Harry Potter</em> series or maybe the first <em>Charlotte&rsquo;s Web</em> movie. I think I probably need to read more books that were made into movies&#8230;</p>

<p>There are a whole bunch on my list though!The obvious ones like <em>Jurassic Park</em> and <em>Forrest Gump</em> have been on my to read lists for forever.</p>

              </ul>
          </div>

          <p><p>I recently finished reading <em>Mary and The Wrongs of Woman</em> by Mary Wollstonecraft. I received this book from a friend of my mothers. I actually received multiple books from my mother&rsquo;s friend, many of them classics such as <em>Villette</em> by Charlotte Bronte, <em>Emma</em> by Jane Austen, <em>Frankenstein</em> by Mary Shelly (who is, by the way, the daughter of Mary Wollstonecraft), etc. I managed to find many books that I enjoyed from her gift.</p>

<p>Honestly, I am mixed about this book. It is essentially two separate stories in one: <em>Mary</em> and <em>The Wrongs of Woman</em>. There are many similarities between the two of them. Both feature a leading female character: Mary in <em>Mary</em> and Maria in <em>The Wrongs of Woman</em>. As you may notice, their names are basically the same since Mary is the English version of Maria. Both are woman who lament the married life. They had married the wrong person, both arranged marriages, and grieve their loss of freedom. Their hearts are captured by a men named Henry. There is much suffering their lives. The similarities go on and on.</p>

<p>At the time this was written, women wanting to be independent must have been a radical idea. Some might say this theme of female independence is extremely feminist. The pains Maria goes to attempt to get a divorce are great and lengthy. Mary avoids to meet her husband for as long she can. In Wollstonecrafts words, wives are the property of men who can do nothing but sit silently and become a slave to their husbands. I strongly felt for Wollstonecraft, as these works must have been incredibly autobiographical.</p>

<p>While I applaud the sentiment behind them, I am not sure if I liked this book much. The exposition can get long and tedious. The Henry in <em>The Wrongs of Woman</em> goes into a lengthy monologue about his history that goes on for four pages although he prefaced this monologue by saying he did not want to talk too much about himself. The Mary&rsquo;s inner dialogue can get extremely tiring and too lavish in words for me to fully comprehend their meaning.</p>

<p>However, this book did stir my emotions and my eyes teared up a bit at points. I am so grateful to live in a world where a woman has more freedom. It&rsquo;s sad this isn&rsquo;t universal across the entire world, yet, but I would say progress is there. As someone who is also apprehensive of tying myself down and getting married, I truly did empathize with these characters. Being with someone for (supposedly) the rest of my life is a great decision that really should not be taken lightly. Even now, it&rsquo;s expected for everyone to go down this path but for those who don&rsquo;t wish for it, it should never be forced upon them.</p>

<p>So, would I recommend this book? I&rsquo;m not sure. I don&rsquo;t think I would actively go out of my way to do so but I wouldn&rsquo;t discourage anyone from reading it. It&rsquo;s definitely worth a shot. Would I keep this book? Sadly, no. This book is going into my donation pile.</p>

              </ul>
          </div>

          <p><p>This is very long overdue but I was blog hopping and came across <a href="https://thedailyprophecy.blogspot.ca">The Daily Prophecy</a> ran by Mel. Her <a href="https://thedailyprophecy.blogspot.ca/2017/01/7th-annual-end-of-year-survey-2016-part.html">latest post</a> was a quick survey of all the books she read in 2016. At the end of her post, she posed the question:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is the best book you read in 2016?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a very tough question for me to answer. I read a couple of very good books this year. Some notable mentions are:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>1984</em> by George Orwell</li>
<li><em>Jane Eyre</em> by Charlotte Brontë</li>
<li><em>Emma</em> by Jane Austen</li>
<li><em>Waiting</em> by Ha Jin</li>
<li><em>A Fisherman of the Inland Sea</em> by Ursula K. Le Guin</li>
</ul>

<p>However, there were two books that really stood out to me this year: <em>Emma</em> and <em>Waiting</em>. I can&rsquo;t decide which was the better book for me.</p>

<p><strong>Waiting by Ha Jin</strong></p>

<p>This book tells the story of a man in an affair and a marriage that he cannot seem to get out of. He had been trying to divorce his wife for years so that he could marry the woman that he actually loves. However, he can&rsquo;t seem to get past the law and the pity he has for his wife and his daughter who live in near poverty.</p>

<p>This love story was extremely touching and it really made me think about marriage. One of my worst fears is marrying the wrong the person. Another one of my fears is getting married. What does it mean to marry a person? In the eyes of the law it&rsquo;s just seen as a formal union. To society, it may just be something you are expected to do and something to uphold at all costs. To others, it&rsquo;s something that you need in order to express your utmost love for another person.</p>

<p>Jin&rsquo;s voice is very authentic. As someone who is unfamiliar with the setting of the story, communist China in the 1960&rsquo;s, it was very easy to get a sense of the culture and values. His characters were sympathetic and their struggles were, although a bit out of place in the context of a modern Western society, very real. This book left a strong impression on my mind.</p>

<p><strong>Emma by Jane Austen</strong></p>

<p>I was immediately charmed by Emma. Although, she is a bit over the top (like her over confidence in her abilities and tendency to over analyze), it made her character all the more enjoyable. Her antics and the way she interacts with others is almost laughable, but all in good fun.</p>

<p>For someone so disinterested in marriage, marriage is all around Emma. Marriages are conducted in her presence and married are made from her presence (or so she says). Her meddlesome behaviour into other people&rsquo;s affairs opens her eyes to realize things about not only herself but of others too.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s not much that I can say about this book that is very thought provoking. Jane Austen adopts a light hearted and comedic tone with ease and the language of classic literature is always hard to resist. Overall, I think <em>Emma</em> made for great entertainment and was a fun book to read.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion: The Best Book of 2016</strong></p>

<p>Even after writing all of this, I am still unsure. I think <em>Waiting</em> had more personal impact whereas <em>Emma</em> was a pleasure to lay my eyes on. I read stories to experience things that I wouldn&rsquo;t have otherwise. I read to be entertained, to think deeply, to feel, and to find bits of myself. Both of these books have hits and misses in this regard. Overall, I think I just might have to give the best book of 2016 to Ha Jin&rsquo;s <em>Waiting</em>.</p>
