<h3 id="day-27-total-body">Day 27: Total Body</h3>

<p>Today is the last day of the beginner&rsquo;s workout calendar, not including the rest day tomorrow! I think I&rsquo;ll make a blog post the day after rest day to talk about how the month went. As for today, today was a lot of sweat and groaning! A lot of cardio today, even if it isn&rsquo;t intensive.</p>

<h3 id="video-1-fat-burning-ladder-for-toned-thighs-and-abs">Video 1: Fat Burning Ladder for Toned Thighs and Abs</h3>

<p>There is a couple of basic moves done in 45, 30, and 20 second bursts. Thankfully, the moves are pretty doable. The only time I paused was when I had to position my laptop to see the screen properly between moves.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Froggy Hop:</em> I did the beginner&rsquo;s version of this move, solely because I didn&rsquo;t want to wake up my dad downstairs. This is the least intensive move in this video.</li>
<li><em>Push Up Plank:</em> I hate these so much!!! Halfway through, I had to switch from the advanced to beginner&rsquo;s version. Push ups are not my area of expertise.</li>
<li><em>Inner Thigh Lunge:</em> I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s because of yesterday&rsquo;s workout, but I felt actual pain doing these. I don&rsquo;t even remember what yesterday&rsquo;s workout was and if there were a lot of thighs involved&#8230;</li>
<li><em>Criss Cross Abs:</em> I&rsquo;m starting to love and hate this move. There is a lot of this move in today&rsquo;s workout.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-2-flat-belly-fat-burner">Video 2: Flat Belly Fat Burner</h3>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>In and Out:</em> I just did froggy hop beginner&rsquo;s version as to not wake up my dad, yet again.</li>
<li><em>Roll Ups:</em> This is my favourite move of all time. It&rsquo;s fun doing them fast. I still can&rsquo;t do them without lifting up my legs but my feet are little a little lower each time.</li>
<li><em>Surfers:</em> This is another move I had to modify to be quieter. I just kind of stepped on one leg and spun around fast.</li>
<li><em>Triple Crunch:</em> I really don&rsquo;t know how to do crunches without straining my neck. In fact, it just feels like I&rsquo;m straining my neck!</li>
<li><em>Burpees:</em> Yet another move I had to modify. I did the silent burpees plus a mini push up.</li>
<li><em>Double Leg Lifts:</em> I tried really hard to focus on my abs with this move. I definitely felt it.</li>
<li><em>Football Runs:</em> Good thing this move focuses on light feet because I really did not want to wake my dad up.</li>
<li><em>Eagle Abs:</em> how do I do these properly? I&rsquo;m doing them in a way that I really feel my abs but I&rsquo;m sure that if someone watched me and then watched Cassey, they would laugh at me, haha!</li>
<li><em>Criss Cross Abs:</em> There is around 2-3 minutes of this move&#8230; It&rsquo;s so hard to do for such a long time! Cassey does add some variation but of course, it&rsquo;s to challenge us and not to make it monotonous.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-3-6-minutes-to-a-sexy-booty">Video 3: 6 Minutes to a Sexy Booty</h3>

<p>Still debating whether or not I want a &ldquo;booty&rdquo; or not. I did the video anyway.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Cross Butt Lift:</em> This move is really interesting&#8230; I could feel the burn through the entire thing. I also did not do it properly because I just could not make my knee touch the floor.</li>
<li><em>Fire Hydrant:</em> When I first tried this move, it was pretty easy but in this video, after those cross butt lifts, my butt was on fire! Ironic, considering the name of the move, haha.</li>
<li><em>Heel Lift:</em> Oh my legs! And more importantly, oh my butt&#8230; The pulses are torturous.</li>
</ul>

<p>I can&rsquo;t remember anymore but I think I&rsquo;ve done this video before. This video is really simple, there is just one move: the candlestick. I think I was doing it properly this time because I started to get tired and I could feel burning in my limbs and my core (I can&rsquo;t be as technical as Cassey, what are my obliques????).</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="video-3-feel-good-soul-stretches">Video 3: Feel Good Soul Stretches</h3>

<p>Feel good soul stretches is a fitting title for this video. There are a lot of lunge stretches in this video, which I&rsquo;m not complaining about. I found that I&rsquo;m not very great with balance but I&rsquo;m pleased to say I didn&rsquo;t fall over once! That stretch was very much needed.</p>

<h3 id="video-1-far-burning-cardio-warmup">Video 1: Far Burning Cardio Warmup</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve done this video so many times that I&rsquo;ve almost memorized everything Cassey said, haha! The moves in this video are easy and fun, as always.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="video-2-hips-butt-8216-n-thighs-super-shaper-workout">Video 2: Hips Butt &#8216;n Thighs Super Shaper Workout</h3>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Hot Potato:</em> This is a nice and easy move to start off the video. When I&rsquo;m rewatching the videos to write these posts, only then do I notice how graceful Cassey looks doing the moves&#8230; Goals.</li>
<li><em>Leg Circles:</em> These aren&rsquo;t hard but tiring. My legs get heavier and heavier with each circle. I had to like look at my legs and will them to go wider, haha!</li>
<li><em>Side Plank Leg Lifts:</em> I had to do the beginner&rsquo;s version of this video, unfortunately. That doesn&rsquo;t mean that I didn&rsquo;t feel the burn!</li>
<li><em>Hip Twists:</em> This is probably the first time I did this move without stopping. I&rsquo;m not sure if I did them 100% correct but I tried my best to power through them and power through them I did!</li>
<li><em>Pointed Butt Pulses:</em> An easy move! My thigh (?) got a little bit tired though.</li>
<li><em>Knee Curlers:</em> This added some difficulty to the pulses in the previous move, which is fine. I liked doing this move even if I felt like I was flailing about.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-3-perfect-legs-workout">Video 3: Perfect Legs Workout</h3>

<p>I finished this video a little after midnight but I&rsquo;m not going to count it as being behind. This video was the harder one out of day 25 but it did feel good.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Half Clam Lifter:</em> I don&rsquo;t really know if I&rsquo;m doing this move right but it definitely hurt. I tried to keep an eye on my leg to see if I had proper form but the rest of my body felt a little bit weird.</li>
<li><em>Half Clam Pulse:</em> This hurt a little bit more but it was easier.</li>
<li><em>Lateral Leg Extension:</em> &ldquo;You feel it?&rdquo; I feel it&#8230; This definitely hurt to do since my legs were feeling tired.</li>
<li><em>Floor tap:</em> My foot lingered a little bit too long on the floor but I made it up with doing more on each leg. The stretch after this move was amazing.</li>
<li><em>Frogger:</em> I love froggers! It&rsquo;s easy but my legs definitely feel it.</li>
<li><em>Frogger Abs:</em> I really like this modification! It&rsquo;s an easy move to do, just like the frogger, but I love that burning feeling in my abs.</li>
<li><em>Heel Clicks:</em> This move is another easy one. Lowering the legs make it a little bit harder.</li>
<li><em>Criss Cross:</em> Another easy move. In another video, Cassey mentioned focusing on lifting the legs and not relying on momentum of the legs. This really added some much needed difficulty.</li>
<li><em>Leg Circles:</em> The tiny circles were killer! The larger circles made my hips click and while there was no pain, I got a little bit concerned with the feeling and the sound. I tried to push through it though!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="day-24-lower-body">Day 24: Lower Body</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m still behind&#8230; Oh well, I mostly caught up today. I still have one video to do for day 25 but it&rsquo;s day 25 now and I have three hours left to do it! Today was pretty hard but that could be due to the fact I did two days in one.</p>

<h3 id="video-1-fat-loss-cardio-workout">Video 1: Fat Loss Cardio Workout</h3>

<p>Cassey looks so cute in her pigtails! This video wasn&rsquo;t hard but it got me sweating and my heart pumping. Seriously, I could feel the sweat pooling in my forehead! Cassey doesn&rsquo;t name all of the moves in this video so I won&rsquo;t bother to list them. While I was doing those knee pumps or whatever, as soon as Cassey said &ldquo;don&rsquo;t elbow yourself,&rdquo; I immediately proceeded to elbow myself. Not on purpose, but it definitely happened.</p>

<p>This video was so hard! Especially since I couldn&rsquo;t do these moves 100% because they were so loud and I didn&rsquo;t want to wake up people in the house.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Squat Claps:</em> Okay, Cassey gives a &ldquo;quiet&rdquo; version of this move but not for the other gajillion moves in this video that are not apartment proof, haha. But man, just doing this move was killer! The quiet version, too!</li>
<li><em>Lengthened Ab Hold:</em> I almost did this move without pausing but I chickened out in the last few seconds. This was hard but when Cassey said she was shaking too, I felt a little bit better.</li>
<li><em>Single Legged Burpee:</em> I did not know how to do this move quietly so I just did a silent burpee and paused the video to do more than what Cassey did.</li>
<li><em>Inching Caterpillar:</em> This move is a little bit strange, in my opinion. The inching forward is a little weird, haha! I mostly felt this move in my arms and not really my abs or legs. Although I did feel it in my legs for sure, just not as much as I thought I would.</li>
<li><em>Plank:</em> Planks AKA my worst enemy. Enough said.</li>
<li><em>Jumping Reptile:</em> Please tell me how to do this move quietly&#8230; I just did each leg one at a time, slowly. So definitely not as good as it should have been.</li>
<li><em>Ballerina Leg Outs:</em> I had so much trouble with this move! I just could not get the balance right. I did a wrong variation of this move and I really did feel my abs working. So I guess that must count for something?</li>
</ul>

<p>These stretches felt really good! I love it when Cassey ends days with stretches, it&rsquo;s a great way to wind down for the day. But I had to go right back into it with day 25, haha. I appreciate the sentiment though.</p>
