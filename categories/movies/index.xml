      <description>I finally got to watch Arrival the other day. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly everything that I expected but I think I wasn&amp;rsquo;t displeased with the twist.
The fist half of the movie follows Louise, a professor who specializes in languages and translations. She is recruited by the government to help translate the language of aliens who had touched down on earth. Together with a mathematician, Ian, they slowly learn the writing system of the aliens.</description>

      <description>Spoilers, beware.
I am not a huge Star Wars fan. I watched the first trilogy very quickly, bits and pieces of the second trilogy, and The Force Awakens. Honestly, most of what I know about Star Wars is from the Lego video games and Family Guy. However, my lack of knowledge of the franchise didn&amp;rsquo;t stop me from going to the theaters and watching the latest installment.
When I first watched the Rogue One trailer, I was left wanting for a little more.</description>
