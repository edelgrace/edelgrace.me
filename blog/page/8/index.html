<blockquote>
<p>To many readers, who have perhaps known Frankenstein only at second hand, the original may well come as a surprise. When Mary Shelley began it, she was only eighteen, though she was already Shelley&rsquo;s mistress and Byron&rsquo;s friend. In her preface she explains how she and Shelley spent part of a wet summer with Byron in Switzerland, amusing themselves by reading and writing ghost stories. Her contribution was Frankenstein, a story about a student of natural philosophy who learns the secret of imparting life to a creature constructed from bones he has collected in charnel-houses. The story is not a study of the macabre, as such, but rather a study of how man uses his power, through science, to manipulate and pervert his own destiny, and this makes it a profoundly disturbing book.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shelley is a lot like her mother. They both love characters who talk and talk and talk.</p>

<p>Honestly, I did not expect most of what happened in this book. Everyone &ldquo;knows&rdquo; the Frankenstein story: mad scientist raises the undead in a creepy laboratory in the mountains during a thunderstorm. It usually seems to end there. Some variations, Frankenstein actually makes a &ldquo;female&rdquo; version and, usually, the female doesn&rsquo;t want anything to do with its male counterpart.</p>

<p>However, I learned that Frankenstein is much more than that. It&rsquo;s a lot more gruesome and morbid than I thought it would be. I wouldn&rsquo;t really classify it as horrifying in any way. Honestly, I was a bit bored by many parts of it. I sympathized with Frankenstein&rsquo;s creation when he told his tale but it was still hard for me to picture him as anything but human.</p>

<p>I will say that I enjoyed how Shelley utilized the unreliable narrator. I can&rsquo;t believe sitting down with someone while they recounted a story as long as this.</p>

<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m glad I read it and got it out of the way but I didn&rsquo;t particularly like the book itself. I don&rsquo;t want to say &ldquo;it was okay&rdquo; AKA 2 stars because that implies there was something good about the book. Not to say there&rsquo;s anything bad but it just wasn&rsquo;t for me.</p>

        <p>I tried to cook more during the month of May. Partly because my mother was out of the country and then cooking was left to us but also because I&rsquo;m trying my best to learn how to cook. Unfortunately, most of what I cooked was pretty simple but I still managed to cook some things. I didn&rsquo;t take pictures of everything I cooked, although I totally should have.</p>

<p><strong>Honey Garlic Chicken Wings</strong></p>

<p><em>I tried so hard and got so far but in the end, it doesn&rsquo;t even matter.</em></p>

<p>Jokes aside, I put a lot of time into making these chicken wings. I floured them, fried them, made the sauce, and cooked them again. It tasted horrible. My brother reassured me they were tasty and he ate most of them but I know a good honey garlic wing when I taste one. The sugar got burnt and I put way too much soy sauce. Oh well, you can&rsquo;t win all the time.</p>

<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/edelgrace.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/WIN_20170508_17_05_59_Pro.png?resize=537%2C419" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p><strong>Mac and Cheese from scratch</strong></p>

<p>I had tried to make mac and cheese from scratch once before. It was not great. This time around, it was absolutely delicious! We used Swiss cheese which wasn&rsquo;t ideal (my brother is on a low sodium diet) but it still tasted great. The cheese turned out nice and creamy as well. Would definitely make again!</p>

<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/edelgrace.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/20170507_122718.jpg?resize=663%2C373" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p><strong>Chili Wrap</strong></p>

<p>I made chili and wrapped it up in a tortilla. Not a lot of brain power needed for this little meal but I was pleased with the results. I may have under-cooked the beans a bit. Next time I know I need to cook them for longer!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you could have lunch with any living authors and/or book bloggers, who would you choose and why?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh man, the living restriction is a tough one. If language wasn&rsquo;t a barrier, I would definitely have lunch with Haruki Murakami. Although I have mixed feelings on his work, I feel like it would be pretty nice to sit down with him and chat over a cup of tea overlooking Tokyo (I&rsquo;m assuming he lives in Tokyo) in some little cafe. I&rsquo;d probably just let him talk about his views on life, his running, his portrayal of women in his novels, and so on.</p>

<p>If language is a barrier, I just might have to sit down and have a chat with Lucy Kinsley. If you are unfamiliar with Lucy, she is an artist with a couple of graphic novels under her belt. I will admit I have a little admiration crush on Lucy. She seems like a fun-loving quirky woman and she would probably know the best hidden place to have lunch at.</p>

        <p>Hooked on Crochet is a Discord server that I am a part of. If you don&rsquo;t know what Discord is, it is essentially a chat client for gamers. You can create your own &ldquo;servers&rdquo; or chat rooms for dedicated topics. Hooked on Crochet is (obviously) a group of crocheters. They organized a yarn swap last spring which I took a part of.</p>

<p>My gifter got me a set of hand dyed Alpaca yarn, a llama stitch marker, and a pattern for a unicorn amigurumi! I really love the stitch marker, it&rsquo;s very cute and handy. The yarn I am planning to use for a shawl eventually, at least that is my plan for it. I will also eventually make a unicorn for one of my cousin&rsquo;s kids, while they&rsquo;re still young.</p>

<p>While I didn&rsquo;t get to take any pictures of the actual yarn I managed to get for my giftee, I did get a picture of the package that I eventually sent out. I also bought him a yarn swift from Amazon from a gift card that I had. What I ended up buying for him was otter stitch markers, a skein of yarn bought from Etsy, Caron Cakes, and some local yarn.</p>

<p>Overall, it was a great experience! I got some cool yarn out of it which was sweet. And I love the fact that my giftee was totally over the moon with what I got him. <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> would do again!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nine Island is an intimate autobiographical novel, told by J, a woman who lives in a glass tower on one of Miami Beach’s lush Venetian Islands. After decades of disaster with men, she is trying to decide whether to withdraw forever from romantic love. Having just returned to Miami from a monthlong reunion with an old flame, “Sir Gold,” and a visit to her fragile mother, J begins translating Ovid’s magical stories about the transformations caused by Eros. “A woman who wants, a man who wants nothing. These two have stalked the world for thousands of years,” she thinks.</p>

<p>When not ruminating over her sexual past and current fantasies, in the company of only her aging cat, J observes the comic, sometimes steamy goings-on among her faded-glamour condo neighbors. One of them, a caring nurse, befriends her, eventually offering the opinion that “if you retire from love&#8230; then you retire from life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m a 22 year old who has had thoughts about giving up on love. Of course, this book intrigued me. What would a middle aged woman&rsquo;s life be like alone and loveless? The protagonist, J, tries to sort out exactly what she wants in life after getting divorced and rekindling an old flame that ultimately went nowhere. At first her cat, mother, and neighbours seem to sustain her. But the past is always creeping up in the back of her mind. When is it okay to give up on love? One of the main characters profoundly remarks, &ldquo;To retire from love is to retire from life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This book has given me a lot of food for thought. I hoped to gain some insights but I don&rsquo;t feel any less confused or more confused after reading it. There seems to be a lot going towards trying to find love. I expressed my feelings of becoming a cat lady to a friend and she replied with, &ldquo;But who&rsquo;s going to take care of you when you&rsquo;re old? If you die, your cats will just eat you.&rdquo; She has a point, which Alison also touched on in the book. Most people who have a family are usually taken care of by their children. Sure, I could admit myself to a retirement home if I get that old but maybe it might be different if I had kids.</p>

<p>And as a human being with certain needs and urges, I thought that I could just, you know, take care of myself in that department when I&rsquo;m older and alone. Alison also addressed this. Ultimately, it really depends if you&rsquo;re okay with that and if you could sustain yourself that way. I think I could get by.</p>

<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s also the loneliness factor. J focuses greatly on her work translating Ovid and her little side project of trying to save a duck. Her hobbies are a little off the wall but are they really hobbies or are they just distractions? I myself have a wealth of projects that should keep me busy and content but they don&rsquo;t always fill as much space as I would like them to sometimes.</p>

<p>Human contact is also a must which J gets no shortage of. Her neighbours, her cat, her past flings, and her mother are all social outlets that she utilizes. I&rsquo;ve entertained the idea of becoming a complete social recluse but I know that would not go out well. As much of an introvert that I (think I) am, I do enjoy being around people. I feel more human that way.</p>

<p>With all these thoughts swirling in my mind I wasn&rsquo;t quite sure what to make of the arguments made in the book. There is really no hard conclusion that J comes to at the end. Maybe she&rsquo;ll stumble into love one day, maybe not. At the moment, she seems pretty okay with where her life is. So is the moral of the story to just go with the flow and take opportunities where they crop up? I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>

<p>While I did focus a little too much on the content, it&rsquo;s not hard to notice that Alison&rsquo;s writing is absolutely dreamy. Her words float around you and bite at you with clever quips and wise insights. Her characters are all a little quirky and feel almost not real but it&rsquo;s not hard to believe people like these exist. I wish I could have slowed down a little bit more to absorb how well written this book was but I was too engrossed in the story.</p>

<p>Overall, I enjoyed this book. I ate it up in two days after a reading dry spell. God, who knew Jane Austen could be so boring sometimes (I was in the process of reading <em>Northanger Abbey</em> at the time)? So this little novel was a good change of pace.</p>
