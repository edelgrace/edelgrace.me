<p>I can&rsquo;t remember anymore but I think I&rsquo;ve done this video before. This video is really simple, there is just one move: the candlestick. I think I was doing it properly this time because I started to get tired and I could feel burning in my limbs and my core (I can&rsquo;t be as technical as Cassey, what are my obliques????).</p>

<h3 id="video-3-feel-good-soul-stretches">Video 3: Feel Good Soul Stretches</h3>

<p>Feel good soul stretches is a fitting title for this video. There are a lot of lunge stretches in this video, which I&rsquo;m not complaining about. I found that I&rsquo;m not very great with balance but I&rsquo;m pleased to say I didn&rsquo;t fall over once! That stretch was very much needed.</p>

<h3 id="day-25-lower-body">Day 25: Lower Body</h3>

<h3 id="video-1-far-burning-cardio-warmup">Video 1: Far Burning Cardio Warmup</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve done this video so many times that I&rsquo;ve almost memorized everything Cassey said, haha! The moves in this video are easy and fun, as always.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="video-2-hips-butt-8216-n-thighs-super-shaper-workout">Video 2: Hips Butt &#8216;n Thighs Super Shaper Workout</h3>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Hot Potato:</em> This is a nice and easy move to start off the video. When I&rsquo;m rewatching the videos to write these posts, only then do I notice how graceful Cassey looks doing the moves&#8230; Goals.</li>
<li><em>Leg Circles:</em> These aren&rsquo;t hard but tiring. My legs get heavier and heavier with each circle. I had to like look at my legs and will them to go wider, haha!</li>
<li><em>Side Plank Leg Lifts:</em> I had to do the beginner&rsquo;s version of this video, unfortunately. That doesn&rsquo;t mean that I didn&rsquo;t feel the burn!</li>
<li><em>Hip Twists:</em> This is probably the first time I did this move without stopping. I&rsquo;m not sure if I did them 100% correct but I tried my best to power through them and power through them I did!</li>
<li><em>Pointed Butt Pulses:</em> An easy move! My thigh (?) got a little bit tired though.</li>
<li><em>Knee Curlers:</em> This added some difficulty to the pulses in the previous move, which is fine. I liked doing this move even if I felt like I was flailing about.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-3-perfect-legs-workout">Video 3: Perfect Legs Workout</h3>

<p>I finished this video a little after midnight but I&rsquo;m not going to count it as being behind. This video was the harder one out of day 25 but it did feel good.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Half Clam Lifter:</em> I don&rsquo;t really know if I&rsquo;m doing this move right but it definitely hurt. I tried to keep an eye on my leg to see if I had proper form but the rest of my body felt a little bit weird.</li>
<li><em>Half Clam Pulse:</em> This hurt a little bit more but it was easier.</li>
<li><em>Lateral Leg Extension:</em> &ldquo;You feel it?&rdquo; I feel it&#8230; This definitely hurt to do since my legs were feeling tired.</li>
<li><em>Floor tap:</em> My foot lingered a little bit too long on the floor but I made it up with doing more on each leg. The stretch after this move was amazing.</li>
<li><em>Frogger:</em> I love froggers! It&rsquo;s easy but my legs definitely feel it.</li>
<li><em>Frogger Abs:</em> I really like this modification! It&rsquo;s an easy move to do, just like the frogger, but I love that burning feeling in my abs.</li>
<li><em>Heel Clicks:</em> This move is another easy one. Lowering the legs make it a little bit harder.</li>
<li><em>Criss Cross:</em> Another easy move. In another video, Cassey mentioned focusing on lifting the legs and not relying on momentum of the legs. This really added some much needed difficulty.</li>
<li><em>Leg Circles:</em> The tiny circles were killer! The larger circles made my hips click and while there was no pain, I got a little bit concerned with the feeling and the sound. I tried to push through it though!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="day-24-lower-body">Day 24: Lower Body</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m still behind&#8230; Oh well, I mostly caught up today. I still have one video to do for day 25 but it&rsquo;s day 25 now and I have three hours left to do it! Today was pretty hard but that could be due to the fact I did two days in one.</p>

<h3 id="video-1-fat-loss-cardio-workout">Video 1: Fat Loss Cardio Workout</h3>

<p>Cassey looks so cute in her pigtails! This video wasn&rsquo;t hard but it got me sweating and my heart pumping. Seriously, I could feel the sweat pooling in my forehead! Cassey doesn&rsquo;t name all of the moves in this video so I won&rsquo;t bother to list them. While I was doing those knee pumps or whatever, as soon as Cassey said &ldquo;don&rsquo;t elbow yourself,&rdquo; I immediately proceeded to elbow myself. Not on purpose, but it definitely happened.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="video-2-flat-stomach-fat-melter">Video 2: Flat Stomach Fat Melter</h3>

<p>This video was so hard! Especially since I couldn&rsquo;t do these moves 100% because they were so loud and I didn&rsquo;t want to wake up people in the house.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Squat Claps:</em> Okay, Cassey gives a &ldquo;quiet&rdquo; version of this move but not for the other gajillion moves in this video that are not apartment proof, haha. But man, just doing this move was killer! The quiet version, too!</li>
<li><em>Lengthened Ab Hold:</em> I almost did this move without pausing but I chickened out in the last few seconds. This was hard but when Cassey said she was shaking too, I felt a little bit better.</li>
<li><em>Single Legged Burpee:</em> I did not know how to do this move quietly so I just did a silent burpee and paused the video to do more than what Cassey did.</li>
<li><em>Inching Caterpillar:</em> This move is a little bit strange, in my opinion. The inching forward is a little weird, haha! I mostly felt this move in my arms and not really my abs or legs. Although I did feel it in my legs for sure, just not as much as I thought I would.</li>
<li><em>Plank:</em> Planks AKA my worst enemy. Enough said.</li>
<li><em>Jumping Reptile:</em> Please tell me how to do this move quietly&#8230; I just did each leg one at a time, slowly. So definitely not as good as it should have been.</li>
<li><em>Ballerina Leg Outs:</em> I had so much trouble with this move! I just could not get the balance right. I did a wrong variation of this move and I really did feel my abs working. So I guess that must count for something?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-3-best-stretches-for-lower-back-pain">Video 3: Best Stretches for Lower Back Pain</h3>

<p>These stretches felt really good! I love it when Cassey ends days with stretches, it&rsquo;s a great way to wind down for the day. But I had to go right back into it with day 25, haha. I appreciate the sentiment though.</p>

<h3 id="day-23-abs">Day 23: Abs</h3>

<p>Okay I&rsquo;m pretty behind. It&rsquo;s now past midnight, I should be doing day 25 today. I&rsquo;m waking up early tomorrow so I&rsquo;ll have to skip out on catching up on day 24 until later in the day. Yesterday (two days ago?) I came home late with a huge head ache and immediately fell asleep. Like I came home, fell on my bed, and went to sleep! My headache was brutal.</p>

<h3 id="video-1-total-body-workout">Video 1: Total Body Workout</h3>

<p>These are getting easier with every video! Except for those hundreds. I still can&rsquo;t do them without pausing. One day I will get there (I say that every time). The leg moves were a little bit tougher today (just by a smidgen) since I had my cycling class today.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="video-2-6-minutes-to-a-sexy-little-waist">Video 2: 6 Minutes to a Sexy Little Waist</h3>

<p>This video wasn&rsquo;t that bad.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Rainbow Oblique:</em> A really interesting move. I felt like I over compensated with this move because I only felt it in my legs and not in my obliques. Also, Cassey looks so graceful doing this move but I&rsquo;m sure I looked like a mess doing it!</li>
<li><em>Windshield Wipers:</em> Another one that I felt I wasn&rsquo;t doing properly. But I did feel a burn, just not in the side. My legs totally felt this one.</li>
<li><em>Waist Whittlers:</em> I find these really hard! I could not do these with the modification. And it took a while to actually get it properly. These killed me!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-3-quick-ab-workout">Video 3: Quick Ab Workout</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Quick.&rdquo; It felt like eternity! I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of long repetitions, I really like it when there&rsquo;s variety in the moves. This video is essentially two move: double leg lift and criss cross. The double leg lift was hard and I could not do it without the beginner&rsquo;s modification. My back keeps wanting to arch and create that hollow. When I tried to flatten my back out, I definitely felt my abs. Which is what was supposed to happen! As for the criss cross, I could only do four without feeling pain already. I had to pause a couple of times but strangely, I found these easier to do.</p>

<h3 id="day-22-total-body">Day 22: Total Body</h3>

<p>I was so close to not doing today&rsquo;s workout because I came home late from a volunteering gig with a raging head ache. I slept for about four hours and woke up around 10:30. It took me a while to get started with the workout, I didn&rsquo;t start until 11:15 and I finished at 11:55! Overall, today was pretty hard but the moves are all relatively simple. It&rsquo;s the repetition and longevity that makes it hard.</p>

<p>The video titles for today make me feel a little bit vain&#8230; I&rsquo;m not really doing these exercises for what the title says but just to get more fit! Although, I really am aiming for the flat stomach&#8230; So I&rsquo;m not totally 100% vain free.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Eagle:</em> It took me a while to finish this move because I kept pausing. I really felt this one in my abs. It&rsquo;s probably the hardest move out of the three videos.</li>
<li><em>Bridge Pulses:</em> A relatively easy move. Near the end I was really feeling my hamstrings. Remember to clench your butt or you will not feel anything!</li>
<li><em>Criss Cross/Scissors:</em> Cassey doesn&rsquo;t really name this move so I&rsquo;m not sure this is the correct name for it. This is a really boring move to do for more than a minute. The legs were definitely hurting a bit.</li>
<li><em>Half Cobra Pushup:</em> I almost did these nonstop, almost. My heart was pumping with this move! My cardio for the day? This was really hard to do over and over again. My arms were burning with this move!</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if these exercises really &ldquo;lift&rdquo; the butt like Cassey says. Do I even want a lifted, firmer butt? Is that a thing to be desired? Well, my butt is pretty flat&#8230; Anyway, the moves are also easy in this video. I didn&rsquo;t have as much trouble with this video compared to the first one.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Bridge Pulses (Again):</em> I actually like this move. It&rsquo;s simple but it burns at the same time. I like the little variations Cassey does to keep it from being too monotonous.</li>
<li><em>Grasshopper:</em> This hurt! But I did it. I&rsquo;m not sure if I felt more successful with the grasshopper compared to the last time I did these. The last five countdown was a struggle but I chased after it!</li>
<li><em>Heel Kicks:</em> So I lost my balance with this move a couple of times, haha. I liked this move though. I could feel myself kicking lower and lower with each kick so I really had to be conscious of that.</li>

<li><p><em>Rainbow Butt:</em> I did not feel this move that much. It could be because I didn&rsquo;t have enough space to do it and couldn&rsquo;t go to my potential? I&rsquo;m not sure. But this was another move that I lost my balance with. Maybe I&rsquo;ll try it later to really feel the burn.</p>

</ul>

<p>Cassey has courage doing these videos in front of the London bridge (I wasn&rsquo;t really listening so I wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was the London bridge or if there really is a London bridge). Cassey doesn&rsquo;t really name her move in this videos so I&rsquo;ll just talk about it generally. These are pretty good post-workout stretches even if doing the splits aren&rsquo;t a goal of mine.</p>
