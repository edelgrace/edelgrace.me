<h3 id="day-16-abs">Day 16: Abs</h3>

<p>Okay, this is the first day that I technically did not do on the right day. I started this one a little after midnight because I was working on an assignment and then I looked at the time&#8230; Whoops, the day went by fast! Today&rsquo;s videos were okay. The first video was mostly good but the second video was killer. My neck hurts more than it should.</p>

<h3 id="video-1-total-body-workout">Video 1: Total Body Workout</h3>

<p>Not much to say about this video except for the fact that those hundreds still get me. I&rsquo;ve been looking at comments and I&rsquo;m not the only one with the same problem. I wish there was a way to fix it though!</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="video-2-5-best-and-most-effective-ab-exercises">Video 2: 5 Best and Most Effective Ab Exercises</h3>

<p>I hate ab videos so much&#8230; So many of them require lifting my shoulders off the ground and it hurts my neck! I really don&rsquo;t know how to do this entire video properly.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Saturn Rings:</em> This is a really creative move. I just wish I could do them properly. The theme of this video is &ldquo;ow my neck omg HOW DO YOU DO THAT???&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t have anything small and heavy with me so I just used my 3DS. I probably might have as well not used a weight at all, haha.</li>
<li><em>Weighted Roll Up:</em> I didn&rsquo;t have enough room to stretch my arm to the side so I just lifted it slightly lower than my other arm holding the &ldquo;weight.&rdquo; These were hard but definitely the easiest move in the video. I got tired which is weird for roll ups!</li>
<li><em>Double Leg Lift:</em> These ones are okay, maybe even easier than the weighted roll up. I&rsquo;m also doubting whether or not I&rsquo;m doing this move correctly though. I feel it more in my legs than in my abs.</li>
<li><em>Criss Cross:</em> I hate these!!! My neck seriously hurts doing these. But halfway through the move Cassey mentioned you didn&rsquo;t have to touch your knees to your elbows and that made it somewhat easier for me after making that adjustment.</li>
<li><em>Hollow Rock:</em> How??? I don&rsquo;t know how to do this move at all! When I get up and I go back down on the floor, my shoulder blades thump hard onto the floor and it hurts. I really don&rsquo;t know how Cassey does it&#8230;</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="day-15-total-body">Day 15: Total Body</h3>

<p>My body issues seem to have improved, minus the random headaches. I tried my best to stay active and not give into my pain. I might have to go to the doctor tomorrow though, if it gets any worse. Both videos today contained moves that were not named so I&rsquo;m not going to bother with going through each move.</p>

<h3 id="video-1-5-minute-ab-express">Video 1: 5 Minute Ab Express</h3>

<p>5 minutes of torture&#8230; Kidding, sort of. I was able to do the majority of the moves in this video. I still struggle with Pilates stance. I know what I should be doing but the execution part, not so much. There was only one move that I really had trouble with.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="video-2-feel-good-soul-stretches">Video 2: Feel Good Soul Stretches</h3>

<p>A lot of lunges in this stretching video. Not a fan of lunges. Also I have very bad balance. That isn&rsquo;t a new development but I just wanted to confirm that nothing has changed, yet.</p>

<h3 id="day-14-rest-day">Day 14: Rest Day</h3>

<p>Ummm, what?? It&rsquo;s rest day already?? I do not believe it. I&rsquo;ve been at this for two weeks now! I feel proud of myself, I never thought I would be able to make it this far. I&rsquo;m officially halfway through the calendar! I decided not to do a workout video today because I&rsquo;ve been so tired and lethargic lately and all of my limbs feel sore. I know this sounds like an excuse but at the moment, I&rsquo;m feeling pretty scared about my health. Recently I started taking a medication and the side effects have been less than stellar. I&rsquo;m trying not to feel too bad about it though because today is &ldquo;rest day&rdquo; after all.</p>

<h3 id="video-1-berrylicious-microwave-minute-muffin">Video 1: Berrylicious Microwave Minute Muffin</h3>

<p>I never actually try these recipes but they are pretty intriguing&#8230; I think I might try this tomorrow morning.</p>

<h3 id="day-13-total-body">Day 13: Total Body</h3>

<h3 id="video-1-5-minute-fat-burner">Video 1: 5 Minute Fat Burner</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Five minutes? Easy peasey.&rdquo; I was so wrong! Cassey wasn&rsquo;t lying when she said it would be tough. This was a hard video, with lots of suffering included (guaranteed).</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Star Jump:</em> These were really hard to do quietly. I definitely started sweating immediately with this move.</li>
<li><em>In and Out Donkey Kicks:</em> All of my workout times are too inconvenient for the people in my house, haha. I tried to be really quiet so I didn&rsquo;t do the kicks too forcefully. I&rsquo;d love to be able to do these moves without worrying about sound.</li>
<li><em>Burpees:</em> I did the silent burpee version but I did add the push up. This really made me start breathing heavily. I hate burpees so much!</li>
<li><em>Mountain Climbers:</em> My feet kept slipping on the rug, haha. This was kind of fun and quick although it was pretty hard!</li>
<li><em>Split Squat Jumps:</em> I&rsquo;m sure my parents were grumbling as I was doing this move. I tried my best not to jump too high but it&rsquo;s inevitable to make some noise whenever jumping is involved.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-2-push-plank-challenger">Video 2: Push Plank Challenger</h3>

<p>This video is essentially just one move. One. Excruciating. Move. I did the &ldquo;beginner&rsquo;s&rdquo; version of this move but I still had trouble. My arms are sore after that! I&rsquo;m really weak&#8230; Thank goodness for this calendar!</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="video-3-killer-legs">Video 3: Killer Legs</h3>

<p>Another short video, which is interesting&#8230; Short but KILLER, as the title would suggest. This is another video that depends on reps over a period of time. So much repetition today!</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Narrow Squat Slider:</em> This move is harder than the other move, which is interesting. My legs were really feeling this one.</li>
<li><em>Narrow Squat Lifter:</em> I don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s easier to lift than to simply extend me leg to the side&#8230; Maybe I didn&rsquo;t lift my leg high enough although I consciously tried to lift my legs as high as possible. Something to work on, probably.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>Three short and brutal videos today. The last video wasn&rsquo;t that bad but the first two definitely got beads of sweat rolling down my neck! I actually prefer that, for some reason. I love it when I sweat from working out. It feels like I&rsquo;m actually doing work. I didn&rsquo;t work to my fullest potential today but I was trying to keep quiet. The only time I can do my workouts are early morning or late at night. Both of those times, someone is sleeping in the house. What a dilemma&#8230; I need to figure that out.</p>

<h3 id="day-12-abs">Day 12: Abs</h3>

<p>Ab workouts are so brutal&#8230; And, of course, that&rsquo;s what everyone wants to workout. Cue the suffering.</p>

<h3 id="video-1-ab-butt-workout">Video 1: Ab &amp; Butt Workout</h3>

<p>I seriously cannot get over how cute Rosanna is! She is absolutely adorable and when she struggles, I feel like I&rsquo;m not alone in ab hell. Somehow, she smiles through all of it! Workout goals&#8230;</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Scissors:</em> Literally the only easy workout in this video.</li>
<li><em>One Leg Crunch:</em> I still keep using my neck instead of my core to do these but it&rsquo;s so hard for me to lift up my shoulders still.</li>
<li><em>Roll ups:</em> Thank goodness for roll ups (again).</li>
<li><em>Balancing Pilates Stances:</em> Thankfully, I made a better attempt at this one compared to last week.</li>
<li><em>Fire Hydrant:</em> For the first time, I actually felt my butt working in this move&#8230; This was another move that was easier this time around!</li>
<li><em>Plank Twists:</em> Add this move to my &ldquo;Edel actually did it this time!&rdquo; list. I don&rsquo;t know what it was but they were easier this week. Although my feet kept pushing away the rug from my feet.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-2-abs-on-fire">Video 2: Abs on Fire</h3>

<p>Cassey was not joking about the title when she named this video &ldquo;abs on fire.&rdquo; My abs&#8230; Were definitely on fire.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Genie Abs:</em> These&#8230; were surprisingly okay! I&rsquo;m really bad at using my core. It wasn&rsquo;t until Cassey made it harder did I start to struggle a little.</li>
<li><em>Eagle Abs:</em> This move is very&#8230; Twisty! I suck at any variation of crunches so this was not a fun move. I don&rsquo;t think I did it right at all. I ended up just holding onto my knees whenever I went up.</li>
<li><em>Runaway Abs:</em> What a cute move. It was hard though because it always hurts to try to lift my shoulders off the floor. I could feel my shoulder blades digging into the ground.</li>
<li><em>Double Leg Stretch/Star Abs:</em> This was hard and I didn&rsquo;t have much room to do these properly. But I really tried to do these. Once again, once Cassey added a little more difficulty to the move, I tried it but just ended up doing the simple version again.</li>
<li><em>Clock Abs:</em> I do not like clock abs! I find it so hard to do and my hips go all over the place. But I tried my best, even if it was at a snail&rsquo;s pace.</li>
<li><em>Hollow Rock:</em> I could not do these very well! I kept sitting up all the way which is what is not what I was supposed to do, I&rsquo;m guessing.</li>
<li><em>Single Leg Drop:</em> You&rsquo;d think this move would be easy but I actually had some trouble with this one. But I pushed through it despite skipping some of the harder variations (completely by accident, I used my phone to watch this video and put it down without checking to see if anything changed).</li>
<li><em>Cheerleader L&rsquo;s:</em> There are two reasons why I was never a cheerleader. A) I have no flexibility or physical ability at all. B) We never had cheerleaders at my high school. So this move was really hard. I could barely do it. Actually, I couldn&rsquo;t do it! I just did it half-halfheartedly.</li>
<li><em>Earthquake:</em> Cassey said to expect shaking. Boy did the shaking happen. Every time Cassey said &ldquo;lower!&rdquo; I laughed and held my position. I did try to go as low as I could but it was not low enough at all.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-3-relax-with-me-stretch">Video 3: Relax with Me Stretch</h3>

<p>I was a little wary doing the stretches because on Friday I was stretching and gave myself a charley horse. The beach scenery was a nice touch. Typical California. I want sun too&#8230;</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Rise and Shine:</em> A move with almost no effort. Just a nice start to the stretching. I felt like a weird flower or something.</li>
<li><em>Side Bend Stretch:</em> Another easy move. My left side was feeling a little sore so I tried my best not to overdo it.</li>
<li><em>Half Rainbow Glute:</em> My left side was definitely not stretched out enough due to my soreness but my right side was feeling nice and taut!</li>
<li><em>Stretching Child/Mini Child Press:</em> Ramping up the difficulty just a tad bit. Presses are hard for me no matter what. But it was still relatively easy.</li>
<li><em>Down Dog:</em> This move actually made me sweaty. How do stretches make me more sweaty than the actual workout itself??</li>
<li><em>Dogging Cobra:</em> This move made me even more sweatier. I got pretty tired by the end and really had to push through it.</li>
<li><em>Head Rolls:</em> Is it a little weird how I&rsquo;m paranoid about cracking my neck? Usually it feels good but I&rsquo;m guessing I had no knots to straighten out today.</li>
<li><em>Soul Stretch:</em> This is definitely a move that makes you sigh with relief. I love the stretch in this one!</li>
<li><em>Long Lunge Twist:</em> My balance was tested in this move. I have no balance.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>It was pretty disheartening to read the comments on the Blogilates page about people feeling discourage by today&rsquo;s videos. The &ldquo;Abs on Fire&rdquo; video was definitely hard and a little outside of my difficulty range. I stumbled through that video and didn&rsquo;t really &ldquo;complete&rdquo; it at all. But I know that I suck at the moment and I&rsquo;m not strong enough and I accepted it. Maybe this the only advantage of being self deprecating all the time? So if you&rsquo;re feeling demotivated by the &ldquo;Abs on Fire&rdquo; video, it&rsquo;s okay. As long as you even attempt some of the moves, you are making progress. You&rsquo;re not there YET but if you keep pushing through, you will be there eventually!</p>
