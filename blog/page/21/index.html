        <p>I recently made a trip to the library. Here&rsquo;s what I managed to grab.</p>

<p><strong>Buried in Books: A Reader&rsquo;s Anthology by Julie Rugg</strong><br />
There are quite a lot of books on my to-read list that I don&rsquo;t recall exactly why they&rsquo;re on the list. But I trust myself if a book is on the list. I actually culled off the more obvious ones but the ones that stayed are ones that really interest me. I like reading about reading, a little ironic but it&rsquo;s interesting to see how others view reading.</p>

<p><strong>Madame Tussaud by Michelle Moran</strong><br />
Yet another unknown. I think this is due to the fact that it is historical fiction involving royalty during the French Revolution.</p>

<p><strong>The Midwich Cuckoos by Jogn Wyndham</strong><br />
I&rsquo;ve been trying to get into science fiction. I adored the sci-fi and fantasy genres when I was younger. I don&rsquo;t quite know what happened to my preferences. I think I got all sappy and romantic but there&rsquo;s no reason why science fiction can&rsquo;t be romantic!</p>

<p><strong>Something New by Lucy Kinsley</strong><br />
Kinsley&rsquo;s previous works were pretty good and I think her drawings are cute and quirky. I love the autobiographical element.</p>

<p><strong>Two Kisses for Maddy by Matthew Logelin</strong><br />
I always try to get some non-fiction into my library trips. My go to is always memoirs. I have yet to read a memoir involving children. Good luck. I do not predict dry eyes for this one.</p>

<p><strong>You Can Act on Camera by D.W. Brown</strong><br />
This one wasn&rsquo;t on any list but I justified it because it was such a slim volume. Seems interesting. I think the book title is lying but we&rsquo;ll see how Brown defends his claim.</p>

        <h4>Dec 7, 2016 | <a href="http://edelgrace.me/life/i-just-culled-my-book-wish-list/#disqus_thread">Comments</a></h4>
        
        <div class="tags">
            <ul>
              
              <li><a href="/categories/books">Books</a></li>

            </ul>
        </div>

        

<p>On Goodreads, my &ldquo;want-to-own&rdquo; shelf used to have 127 books in it. Now it has five.</p>

<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been bit by the konmari bug. I&rsquo;ve konmari&rsquo;d my wardrobe and my books so far. I&rsquo;m still stuck on the books. I decided it would be fitting to prevent my book collection from growing back to it&rsquo;s ridiculous size and get rid of anything that doesn&rsquo;t spark joy on my book wish list.</p>

<h3 id="books-that-made-the-cut">Books that made the cut</h3>

<p><strong>The Last Unicorn by Peter S. Beagle</strong><br />
I read this book a couple of years ago. Although it&rsquo;s aimed at a younger audience, I really enjoyed this story. After reading it, I went to watch the animated movie as well. A small part of me has always been fascinated by unicorns and horses (I blame Sailor Moon as the source of that).</p>

<p><strong>The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde</strong><br />
To be honest, I don&rsquo;t remember much of this book but I do remember being in awe of Wilde&rsquo;s writing. I remember the last few pages more than anything. It was not exactly terrifying but it was a bit&#8230; Grotesque? I mostly want this book so I can re-read it.</p>

<p><strong>The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov</strong><br />
A couple of years ago I took a Russian Literature course and had to do a group presentation on this book. This book is probably one of the very few that I actually read front to back for a class. Actually, I read all the required books in this course. That was a first for me. Bulgakov&rsquo;s imagination is borderline execessive with this work but I do like his alternative history spin on Jesus&rsquo; life.</p>

<p><strong>The Glass Menagerie by Tenesee Williams</strong><br />
Marie Kondo&rsquo;s motto is to get rid of anything that doesn&rsquo;t spark joy. This play is incredibly sad but in a way, it also sparks joy for me. I find it to be such a heartbreakingly simple story that I can&rsquo;t help but appreciate it.</p>

<p><strong>Sabriel by Garth Nix</strong><br />
When I was younger, I was totally absorbed in fantasy. I don&rsquo;t know what happened, I hardly ever read any of the fantasy genre anymore. Sabriel really touched something in me. I got sucked into the world. One of my childhood friends recently (as in, like a couple of weeks ago) told me that I reminded her of Sabriel. She was the one who recommended this book to me way back when. That&rsquo;s another thing that I appreciate about this book.</p>

<h3 id="books-that-almost-made-the-cut">Books that almost made the cut</h3>

<p><strong>Paradise Kiss series by Ai Yazawa</strong><br />
Okay, I&rsquo;m still on the fence about this one. I love this series and I love Ai Yazawa&rsquo;s work. Paradise Kiss is one of those series that sat with me for a while. Maybe I&rsquo;ll have to read this one over again and see how I feel about it. The reason why I&rsquo;m not sure is because I feel like there&rsquo;s something unsettling about it. It&rsquo;s a little similar to how I feel about <em>The Glass Menagerie</em>. It&rsquo;s incredibly bittersweet. There are some scenes that I remember that actually make me feel a pang in my chest. I&rsquo;m tearing up right now thinking about it!</p>

<p><strong>A Great and Terrible Beauty by Libba Bray</strong><br />
The Gemma Doyle series is pretty okay but damn, the covers are gorgeous (yes, I&rsquo;m a little shallow). I love the gothic setting and historical aspect of it but unfortunately, it was lacking in content a little. It would be nice to have it sit on my shelf and look pretty but I would never pick it up and read it again.</p>

        <p>I recently resolved not to take out any library books unless they were on my to read list. Here&rsquo;s what I took out on my latest trip to the library!</p>

<p><strong>Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson</strong><br />
I don&rsquo;t remember why or how this book got onto my to read list but I know that it&rsquo;s been on the list for quite a while. I was glad to see the book sitting on the shelf since I&rsquo;ve been looking for it.</p>

<p><strong>Sputnik Sweetheart by Haruki Murakami</strong><br />
Pretty much all of Murakami&rsquo;s books are on my to read list. <em>Sputnik Sweetheart</em> is no exception. Usually there are three things I always go check when I go to the library: the manga section, Jodi Picoult, and Haruki Murakami. Murakami is pretty popular so I was lucky I got a hold on this novel.</p>

<p><strong>The Secret Diaries of Charlotte Bronte by Syrie James</strong><br />
I adore the Bronte family and pretty much everything Bronte related, non-fiction or fiction, is on my to read list.</p>

        <h3><a href="http://edelgrace.me/life/reading-the-secret-diaries-of-charlotte-bronte/">Reading: The Secret Diaries of Charlotte Brontë</a></h3>
        <h4>Dec 5, 2016 | <a href="http://edelgrace.me/life/reading-the-secret-diaries-of-charlotte-bronte/#disqus_thread">Comments</a></h4>
        
        <div class="tags">

            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>I&rsquo;m extremely fond of Charlotte Brontë. <em>Villette</em> is easily my favourite novel and I hold it very close to my heart. A couple week ago I finally got around to reading <em>Jane Eyre</em> and it did not disappoint. The other members of the Brontë family are not to be overlooked either. I enjoyed Emily&rsquo;s <em>Wuthering Heights</em> and all of Anne&rsquo;s books are in my to read list. So when I stumbled upon <em>The Secret Diaries of Charlotte Brontë</em> by Syrie James in the library, I couldn&rsquo;t resist picking it up.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s something about the Brontë family that I find incredibly interesting. I&rsquo;m a romantic at heart and the family&rsquo;s strange ability to be surrounded by tragedy is appealing to me. I&rsquo;ve watched documentaries and read numerous articles about them. I&rsquo;ve looked at Branwell&rsquo;s family portrait numerous times and tried to imagine what the Brontë sisters would have looked like. I&rsquo;ve seen George Richmond&rsquo;s chalk sketch of Charlotte and built a picture of Charlotte in my head. I gazed at photos of the moors and wondered at what attracted the family to such a dull place. I envied their love for literature and their eagerness to be absorbed in their fictional worlds. Unfortunately, this all worked against my favour while I began to read <em>The Secret Diaries of Charlotte Brontë</em>.</p>

<p>The first couple of pages were disappointing to me. The book claimed to be written by Charlotte&rsquo;s hand but I (foolishly) despaired at how the style was so unlike Charlotte. Her character in my head did not align with James&rsquo; vision. When I pictured the events, I pictured a woman who was not Charlotte. She was more like Jane Austen&rsquo;s Emma, a beautiful woman with a naive and girlish charm. I could not picture Charlotte&rsquo;s plain face on this Emma. This is not James&rsquo; fault in the slightest. It&rsquo;s my own expectations that ruined it for me.</p>

<p>However, it got better. I eventually came to accept Emma as Charlotte. In a way, I still don&rsquo;t 100% see my Charlotte in the pages. I&rsquo;m not yet half way through the book but I&rsquo;m very engrossed in it. I appreciate all the references and while not entirely in Charlotte&rsquo;s style, it is Charlotte-esque in content. It&rsquo;s hard for it to not reflect any of Charlotte&rsquo;s essence, since much of her work is modelled after her own life and the novel fully appreciates both her work and her life.</p>

<p>So far, I guess you could say that I like it.</p>

        <p>Over the weekend I had eaten two plates piled high with sweet American-Chinese prepared meats, a plate full of sweet desserts, and a take-out box of homemade cookies. On Friday I almost consumed an entire bag of buttery popcorn but the bag spilled into the aisle as it descended up the movie theatre steps. As I heard the small popped kernels tumble out of the bag, I felt both relief and disappointment. I was looking forward to eating the buttery goodness the moment I received the free movie tickets as a gift. Going to the movies was an excellent excuse to gorge on popcorn. But I also felt relieved at the amount of calories that didn&rsquo;t pass through my mouth. The next day, however, I walked into the grocery store and bought a box of microwaveable popcorn. My justification was that I would have eaten the popcorn eventually anyway.</p>

<p>So Sunday night I tried hard not to think about all the energy I consumed and how little I exerted. Well, I walked over 10k steps on Friday from window shopping. But it still wasn&rsquo;t enough.</p>

<p>I made a resolution to myself: new week, new me. I will definitely cut down on my food consumption.</p>

<p>On Monday I grabbed a bag of chips from the vending machine. I had no idea what kind of flavour &ldquo;Au Gratin&rdquo; was but it looked good. The cheesy taste was too overpowering. To drown out the taste I got another bag of chips and a chocolate bar.</p>

<p>Tuesday I baked three cheesecakes. I only intend to eat one and giveaway three but I accidently used 1 cup of sugar instead of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup.</p>

<p>Today I went out for lunch at Tim Hortons. A toasted plain bagel with cream cheese and a cafe mocha. Not too bad but I also plan on eating that cheesecake later today.</p>

<p>New month, new me, probably.</p>
