<blockquote>
<p>If you are at a really good point in a book and the phone rings or the door bell rings, do you stop reading or let the phone or door bell go unanswered?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Honestly, I would get up and check them. Mostly because, in my mind, those things don&rsquo;t happen unless there is something important. Who actually calls people anymore? The only phone calls I get are usually important such as my bank, my doctor, etc. If someone is taking the time to visit my home, I will go look at the door. Nine times out of ten it is usually just a door to door salesperson but I won&rsquo;t let him in. Now if it was a text message, I will definitely let that go unanswered.</p>

<p>Honestly, it&rsquo;s rare for me to be so engrossed in a book that way. If it really is that good, I will probably let my brother or parents look at the door or answer my phone instead. Unless they yell for me to do it instead, haha!</p>

        <p>I have been going to the Brentwood Village Mall for the past couple of years now and I have never ever noticed this nice little yarn store before until I started up crochet. <a href="http://www.theknittingroom.ca/">The Knitting Room</a> is a small store located in a mall close to my university. I usually go to the mall when I&rsquo;m itching to walk somewhere between classes. I decided to finally visit The Knitting Room for the first time and came away with some yarn! Honestly, it would have been rude to visit and not buy anything!</p>

<p>This first yarn attracted me mainly because of the colours. I really love any color combination containing brown, blue, and white.</p>

<p>These two I also chose because of the colour. I find that lately I&rsquo;m really drawn towards greens and blues. I have yet to find the perfect orange-y yarn that I really covet and desire. One of these days!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After thirty years of marriage, producing three now-grown children, Mike and Anna have settled into entrenched domesticity. She is skillful and poised and still beautiful, an instructor of English at the city college. He is a successful graphic artist on the verge of retirement, his awards and ambitions and accomplishments largely behind him. Though the couple’s erotic life has dimmed somewhat, he still considers her ravishing.</p>

<p>But their apparent balance is thrown asunder when Anna breaks the normal silence of their breakfast table with uncontrollable babble about hummingbirds. After an emergency consultation with a neurologist, they have a diagnosis: confabulation, or the scrambling of time, memories and language due to a dangerous aneurysm in Anna’s brain that could burst at any moment.</p>

<p>Not knowing how much time they have left with the beloved Anna, Mike and the kids rally together to support her through the terror of her disintegrating mind. But the unbearable strain of the situation is worsened by another worry that is haunting Mike: he suspects that his two eldest children, Charlotte and Fred, know of his past infidelity.</p>

<p>Several years ago, Anna and Mike took a trip to Egypt, hoping the shared adventure would thwart their mid-life marriage blues. Instead, the trip deepened the chasm, his sexual jealousy and insecurities swamping her attempts at intimacy. Their estrangement worsened when they returned home to discover that their youngest daughter, Sasha, was in hospital, having overdosed on drugs. Anna was furious with Mike for his cool response at the time, which she interpreted as unfeeling.</p>

<p>Two weeks later Mike began his affair, with a much younger woman dissimilar to Anna in all respects. He persisted in the romance for three years, feeling young and vital and once again in control, at least for a time.</p>

<p>The affair is long over but today, as Anna disappears into a terrifying collapse of time and language, Mike is wracked by his dilemma: should he keep his silence about the affair and spare his family more pain, or should he seize the opportunity to be wholly honest with the woman he loves, possibly in the last days of her life? Perhaps the answer lies in his drawings, the means of communication with which he is most comfortable. Can he codify his emotions into pictures? Can he articulate his love and regret and sorrow to his wife – and to himself – without having to say the heart-rending words out loud?</p>

<p>Narrated by a terrified male protagonist whose deep yearning for forgiveness might only be granted by a woman in the grips of dementia, Tessa McWatt’s Vital Signs is a thought-provoking and mesmerizing literary accomplishment – a compassionate and visceral study of a marriage at the brink of catastrophe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I received this ARC copy of this book from First Reads back in like 2011 and I am completely glad I did. This book was the first First Reads books that I so desperately and truly wanted to win. I read the summary and immediately felt that this seemed like a book that I would love to pieces. I&rsquo;m glad that my first instinct wasn&rsquo;t wrong.</p>

<p>Around four hours ago, I looked into the mail and saw the package waiting for me. Immediately, I took it inside and opened it. Ever since then, I&rsquo;ve been reading it, taking a few breaks to write down what I thought about it as I read.</p>

<p>The very first few pages were emotional to me, and I knew how much of a ride I was in for. I fell completely in love with McWatt&rsquo;s writing. Everything was so beautifully written and captured me.</p>

<p>Every single one of the characters were incredibly real. Their feelings were real as well. It was heartbreaking to read but at the same time, some scenes were just so beautiful and touching.</p>

<p>I was incredibly moved by this novel. My only complaint however, are the pictures. I understand that the pictures serve an important part to the story, but they also distracted me from the story. They seemed very abrupt, and I didn&rsquo;t really like their placement. But, they were very well done. I just wish it didn&rsquo;t interrupt the flow as much. I did love the very last drawing though. It took me a while to figure out the meaning, but I came to love it.</p>

<p>Vital Signs is definitely a short and bittersweet read. I will have to make sure to buy it once it comes out. Spoiler alert, I eventually did years later under the impression that I never read it in the first place. Interesting how fate works. I re-read it and it was all extremely fresh to me. I am a little hurt that the book didn&rsquo;t leave an impact that would last over six years. However, I&rsquo;m glad I got to experience it again with a blank mind with little to no expectations.</p>

<p>At the moment, my side bar is laid out by links to my favourite bloggers, categories, monthly archives, and recent comments. I don&rsquo;t like to clutter my side bar with too much, especially images, so it&rsquo;s mostly all text. I love minimalist designs.</p>

        <p>Since I recently took up crochet, I have also been itching to start learning how to knit as well. I figure it would be advantageous to take up both of the more well known fiber art hobbies. So I signed up for lessons at one of my local yarn stores.</p>

<p>The store itself is very cozy and quaint. It&rsquo;s literally a small house filled to the brim with yarn. The people at the front desk are extremely nice and while I was waiting for class to start, they offered me some tea.</p>

<p>The classes take place in the basement which can be hard for people who have trouble going up or down stairs. However, the room is small and cozy (looks like it could fit five or six people at most) and a perfectly intimate setting for holding a class for knitting.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, they are moving locations this summer so who knows (I don&rsquo;t) what the new store will look like. Hopefully it still retains it&rsquo;s small store charm.</p>

<p>The instructor Brenda, was incredibly patient and extremely knowledgeable. She goes through teaching us like a breeze. Her instructions were easy to follow however I am a total hands-on learner. I need to do it with someone coaching me and as soon as I see it happen, I can get it!</p>

<p>The style of knitting that Brenda taught us was English style. I had never known there were different styles of knitting. I was a little surprised at how much arms are involved but I have taken a look at some YouTube videos of English style knitters and some have perfected the style to a tee without the large arm movements. I&rsquo;m still learning!</p>

<p>In the class we are working towards making a ribbed cowl with Lion Brand Wool-Ease Thick and Quick yarn. I chose the Blossom colour as it was fairly light and according to Brenda, it would look great on me with my skin tone.</p>

<p>So far, the pattern starts with a 16 loop cast on and alternating knit and purl stitches. Here are the first few rows on my first attempt.</p>
