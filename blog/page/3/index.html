<blockquote>
<p>Yeong-hye and her husband are ordinary people. He is an office worker with moderate ambitions and mild manners; she is an uninspired but dutiful wife. The acceptable flatline of their marriage is interrupted when Yeong-hye, seeking a more &#8216;plant-like&rsquo; existence, decides to become a vegetarian, prompted by grotesque recurring nightmares. In South Korea, where vegetarianism is almost unheard-of and societal mores are strictly obeyed, Yeong-hye&rsquo;s decision is a shocking act of subversion. Her passive rebellion manifests in ever more bizarre and frightening forms, leading her bland husband to self-justified acts of sexual sadism. His cruelties drive her towards attempted suicide and hospitalisation. She unknowingly captivates her sister&rsquo;s husband, a video artist. She becomes the focus of his increasingly erotic and unhinged artworks, while spiralling further and further into her fantasies of abandoning her fleshly prison and becoming &#8211; impossibly, ecstatically &#8211; a tree.</p>

<p>Fraught, disturbing and beautiful, The Vegetarian is a novel about modern day South Korea, but also a novel about shame, desire and our faltering attempts to understand others, from one imprisoned body to another.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I remember one time I participated in a blog hop where one of the prompts mentioned seeking out diverse voices, usually cultural. I was a little shocked that a lot of people said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t seek it out or make a point to find authors with a different point of view from mine.&rdquo; I think there is a lot of different voices out there that you need to seek out because their voices need to be heard.</p>

<p>One of my friends started up a book club, #milliesbookclub, that would explore Asian American authors and their works. Being Asian American myself (Asian Canadian to be exact), I was extremely interested. For minorities, it can be easy to have your voice drowned out. In general, it&rsquo;s easy to get lost in the literature industry regardless but it seemed important to intentionally seek out these Asian American authors. So out of this book club, <em>The Vegetarian</em> was chosen.</p>

<p>My first impression of this novel was that it was extremely Murakami-esque. Haruki Murakami almost always features peculiar women and these women almost always serve as some sort of motivator for the male protagonists. Murakami is frequently accused to using the manic pixie dream girl trope again and again and it was a little bit disappointing to see this again in another Asian author.</p>

<p>The male characters in this book were no different from how Murakami portrays his male characters. Yeong-hye&rsquo;s brother-in-law is obsessed with her to the point of his destroying his marriage and taking advantage of her mental vulnerability. Yeong-hye&rsquo;s husband forces himself upon her and selfishly only thinks of how her antics affect him. Yeong-hye&rsquo;s father was abusive to her for her entire life, even displaying physical aggression towards her in her adult life. It&rsquo;s no wonder that Yeong-hye retreats inward and pursues the notion that becoming a tree would bring the ultimate state of nirvana.</p>

<p>While I did find Yeong-hye&rsquo;s passion a little ridiculous and self destructive, I have finally come to the conclusion (with a little bit of help) that it boiled down to a form of escapism and served as a great foil to Yeong-hye&rsquo;s sister.</p>

<p>It maybe be obvious that Yeong-hye wasn&rsquo;t so keen on the life that she lived due to all of the not-so-great males she had around her. I still don&rsquo;t see the significance in becoming a tree but I do love how this demonstrates a positive attribute that Yeong-hye possesses which her sister does not.</p>

<p>Despite everything, Yeong-hye is true to herself. Compared to her sister, she is not a subservient and too obedient woman who is too polite to the point of irritation. Yeong-hye&rsquo;s brother-in-law makes this observation as he wonders why his wife would not lash out at him for his absenteeism in the family and instead becomes a little bit too accommodating. This is also shown when Yeong-hye&rsquo;s sister has a strong sense of duty towards her son which keeps her from succumbing to her depression whereas Yeong-hye is eager to let go of what little life she has left regardless of her obligations. Yeong-hye is more willing to break conventions as she only answers to herself.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, most of the other members of the book club didn&rsquo;t like this novel. I can see why. The male characters are disgusting and abhorrent. The fragile and subservient Asian woman stereotype is tiring. It&rsquo;s a frustrating read that reminds you that society is pretty much still patriarchal and misogynistic. It isn&rsquo;t empowering in the slightest, one of the aims the book club was created to begin with. Honestly, it&rsquo;s the last book that I would ever thing Millie would like to read. However, there was something fascinating about this book that never let me put it down until I finished.</p>

<p>I became invested in Yeong-hye and her sister. I could have skipped all the sections about Yeonh-hye&rsquo;s husband and brother-in-law easily. These two women wronged by the most important men in their lives struck a chord with me. The book made me want to know what became of the two sisters and how they could possibly rebuild their lives. I wanted to know what really went on their minds while we saw their husband&rsquo;s points of view and who they really were behind who the men thought they were.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I think Han Kang made the right choice using male narrators for a good portion of the book because it really painted an accurate picture of the situation. However, it feels like she barely scratched the surface with the female characters but there was some sort of sense of redemption for the female characters.</p>

<p>If you can look past the social undertones in the book, I think it would be a good read. Most reviews I&rsquo;ve seen focused on the oddity and weirdness of the situation and less on the characters, which is fine but you&rsquo;ll never know how you feel about the book until you read it for yourself.</p>

        <p>A couple of days ago I was behind on my granny squares for my temperature blanket. If you don&rsquo;t know, temperature blankets consist of one square a day and each square represents the temperature of that day. Thankfully, it&rsquo;s easy to catch up with temperature blankets! Even though I&rsquo;m caught up with the squares, I still haven&rsquo;t woven the ends in yet nor have I joined them. Eek!</p>

<p>Last week I was babysitting my little cousin and he was playing with my yarn. He made a &ldquo;bunny&rdquo; and asked me to give it eyes and a nose. I tried my best with what I was given. I wasn&rsquo;t satisfied but my cousin was so impressed. I love how innocent he is.</p>

<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been thinking how fast he&rsquo;s growing up. He just recently turned 11 and he&rsquo;s already almost as tall as me! Now that he&rsquo;s older he&rsquo;s less receptive to my affections which is a little disheartening to me since he is still so cute and sweet!</p>

<p>If I never have kids, I&rsquo;d think I&rsquo;d be content with it because I am surrounded by kids in my extended family and I&rsquo;ve already watched many of them grow up. We celebrated my cousin&rsquo;s birthday over the weekend. She just turned 19 and I still marvel over how it seemed like she was a small little girl just yesterday. The same goes for her brother. He&rsquo;s going into grade twelve this year and I just can&rsquo;t believe it. We went to a night market at our mall recently and my brother, cousin, and I just walked around by ourselves talking. It&rsquo;s amazing to me how he has grown into his own person. Of course, while we were there, we got to chow down on some delicious food. I got a burger at Bandit Burger and it was absolutely delicious.</p>

<p>The next day we went to the park to celebrate my cousin&rsquo;s birthday and we spent almost eight hours there. There was a lot of eating and we took a walk and just chatted together. We even took a nap under the tree from the food overload. It was pretty relaxing and I even sat by the water&rsquo;s edge to knit for a little bit.</p>

<p>One of my older cousins saw me knitting and asked if I could make her daughter a hat. I said yes! I&rsquo;m a little nervous because I&rsquo;ve never had anyone ask me to make anything before but I would love to make my second cousin a hat. My cousin&rsquo;s daughter requested that it be pink. I have no pink yarn! I guess I&rsquo;ll be shopping around for pink yarn soon.</p>

        <p>I recently started learning how to use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">emacs</a>, which is a text editor and a Lisp interpreter. During my quest for resources, I came across a number of developers and their blogs. Since I&rsquo;m always intrigued by what sort of tools developers use to make their blogs, I did a little snooping. A shocking number of people who didn&rsquo;t use WordPress as their blogging platform opted for flat files instead.</p>

<p>Now I had dabbled a little bit in static pages before with <a href="https://www.boltwire.com/">BoltWire</a> but ultimately abandoned it to go back to WordPress. I think where I went wrong with BoltWire was that it simply did not have a big enough community (although they are an extremely dedicated community) to keep me reassured that I had made the right choice.</p>

<p>However, I know flat files in general is a real and upcoming thing. Since I&rsquo;m planning to use emacs and Markdown files as my main way of documenting things, it would be easy to use it in my blogging as well.</p>

<p>So my main reasons for switching to a flat file system:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Better security</strong><br />
WordPress was giving me so much trouble when it came to security. Yes, Jetpack did help in reducing spam and MySQL doesn&rsquo;t randomly stop working anymore but you have to admit that using WordPress on a Digital Ocean server makes you a target.</li></p></li>

<li><p><strong>Version control</strong><br />
Yes, WordPress does have versioning for content however it would be much easier to have version control for settings, themes, etc. over the WordPress kind.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Less bloat</strong><br />
I don&rsquo;t need everything that WordPress offers and honestly sometimes I feel like it might be a bit overkill. Since the server I&rsquo;m on has limited RAM and disk space, I need to be careful about the amount of resources I use. It helps that I don&rsquo;t have many visitors to begin with but still!</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Faster loading times</strong><br />
While I&rsquo;m unsure if this is too much of a concern for me but loading times do make me a bit worried. Fetching from a database can be quite slow.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>I want a more future proof blogging system</strong><br />
There are options to export your content into XML files in WordPress however it can&rsquo;t beat readable Markdown, which many static file systems use. The fact that everything is file based is future proof in itself. Migrating from one server to the other wouldn&rsquo;t be too much hard work.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>My concerns:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What comment system to use</strong><br />
I do not like Disqus. I dislike the fact that I have to register for yet another site and people can&rsquo;t click on my name on a comment and go directly to my website. I also don&rsquo;t like the fact that the comments don&rsquo;t stay on my server. I want to be able to have my comments.</li>
<li><strong>Learning curve</strong><br />
This would be a little more technically involved at first to get everything installed, just due to the nature of it not being a one-click install.</li>
<li><strong>So many choices!</strong><br />
There is no shortage of flat file systems out there. Like I&rsquo;ve said, I&rsquo;ve dabbled in BoltWire before and wiki systems but it&rsquo;s so hard to find one that will work for you when there&rsquo;s a breadth of options.</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the main frameworks I&rsquo;ve been looking at is <a href="http://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> which is used by <a href="https://baty.net/">Baty.net</a>, <a href="http://www.modernemacs.com">Modern Emacs</a>, <a href="https://kieranhealy.org">kieranHealy.org</a>, <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog">but she&rsquo;s a girl&#8230;</a>, and more. I am very attracted to this option because it seems like it could work pretty well with an emacs workflow.</p>

<p>Thankfully, I finally recovered my previous website, <a href="http://erzadel.net">erzadel.net</a> and now have access to my old blog posts. I&rsquo;ll be tinkering with that this weekend and try to have a clone of my old blog up and running on my local machine. We&rsquo;ll see how it goes!</p>

        <p>I finally finished one Bernat Blanket Stripes cake! I am going to move onto cake number two for my afghan ripple blanket. I don&rsquo;t really know yet who this blanket will be for. My mom keeps asking me and I can&rsquo;t make up my mind. I am pretty happy that I am making progress on this blanket. I might need three cakes for this though and not the two that I have.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, my progress on the Moon Blossom afghan square is not going as well. I decided that I will frog the entire thing because I missed a petal. Usually when I make a mistake, I can power through it without too much of a difference in the final product however a whole missing petal would have changed it drastically. So, I frogged it. Here it is before it was frogged. Sometimes you just have to make the tough decisions.</p>

        <p>Yesterday <a href="http://stashlounge.com/">Yesterday</a> opened up at their new location across the street. I dragged my brother along with me to the opening.</p>

<p>It was absolutely lovely! They had a DJ play some music in the background, a coffee bar, and a table of yummy sweets in the back. They even had door prizes, which I suspect I didn&rsquo;t win anything from but that&rsquo;s totally okay.</p>

<p>In terms of the space, it&rsquo;s great! It&rsquo;s absolutely spacious while also filled to the brim with yarn. I enjoyed the rustic decorations like the vintage crates and items like typewriters. There are shelves upon shelves of yarn. Near the register there is a wall dedicated to various knitting and crochet accessories. There&rsquo;s another wall where yarn is hung on, absolutely covering the entire space. It was incredibly cozy and it still retained it&rsquo;s intimate feel as their previous location.</p>

<p>At first I was going in there thinking I wouldn&rsquo;t buy anything but then I decided that it would be rude not to! After much contemplation and running through the patterns I want to try in my mind, I decided on two skeins of Brooklyn Tweed Shelter in Barn Owl. This was after eating a couple of macaroons and cookies while walking through the crowded store. These two skeins will make my very first knitted hat!</p>

<p>With my purchase, I even got a free reusable bag! It&rsquo;s so sturdy and pretty. I think it will be a project bag or a maybe a library bag. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<p>That day I also went to the park with some relatives. I finally gave the blanket I made for my cousin&rsquo;s newborn son and my cousin was head over heels over it! She said it was like store quality which made me blush a little. I am very pleased that she was happy with it.</p>

<p>I also biked around Fish Creek park for two hours with my dad. We decided to take a different route than we usually do. It was a really nice bike ride although maybe a little bit too hot! We even stopped for ice cream at Annie&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;ve never been before but it&rsquo;s a sweet little cafe just off the bike path. The ice cream scoops are huge! I definitely got my money&rsquo;s worth from it.</p>
