            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>This is very long overdue but I was blog hopping and came across <a href="https://thedailyprophecy.blogspot.ca">The Daily Prophecy</a> ran by Mel. Her <a href="https://thedailyprophecy.blogspot.ca/2017/01/7th-annual-end-of-year-survey-2016-part.html">latest post</a> was a quick survey of all the books she read in 2016. At the end of her post, she posed the question:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is the best book you read in 2016?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a very tough question for me to answer. I read a couple of very good books this year. Some notable mentions are:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>1984</em> by George Orwell</li>
<li><em>Jane Eyre</em> by Charlotte Brontë</li>
<li><em>Emma</em> by Jane Austen</li>
<li><em>Waiting</em> by Ha Jin</li>
<li><em>A Fisherman of the Inland Sea</em> by Ursula K. Le Guin</li>
</ul>

<p>However, there were two books that really stood out to me this year: <em>Emma</em> and <em>Waiting</em>. I can&rsquo;t decide which was the better book for me.</p>

<p><strong>Waiting by Ha Jin</strong></p>

<p>This book tells the story of a man in an affair and a marriage that he cannot seem to get out of. He had been trying to divorce his wife for years so that he could marry the woman that he actually loves. However, he can&rsquo;t seem to get past the law and the pity he has for his wife and his daughter who live in near poverty.</p>

<p>This love story was extremely touching and it really made me think about marriage. One of my worst fears is marrying the wrong the person. Another one of my fears is getting married. What does it mean to marry a person? In the eyes of the law it&rsquo;s just seen as a formal union. To society, it may just be something you are expected to do and something to uphold at all costs. To others, it&rsquo;s something that you need in order to express your utmost love for another person.</p>

<p>Jin&rsquo;s voice is very authentic. As someone who is unfamiliar with the setting of the story, communist China in the 1960&rsquo;s, it was very easy to get a sense of the culture and values. His characters were sympathetic and their struggles were, although a bit out of place in the context of a modern Western society, very real. This book left a strong impression on my mind.</p>

<p><strong>Emma by Jane Austen</strong></p>

<p>I was immediately charmed by Emma. Although, she is a bit over the top (like her over confidence in her abilities and tendency to over analyze), it made her character all the more enjoyable. Her antics and the way she interacts with others is almost laughable, but all in good fun.</p>

<p>For someone so disinterested in marriage, marriage is all around Emma. Marriages are conducted in her presence and married are made from her presence (or so she says). Her meddlesome behaviour into other people&rsquo;s affairs opens her eyes to realize things about not only herself but of others too.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s not much that I can say about this book that is very thought provoking. Jane Austen adopts a light hearted and comedic tone with ease and the language of classic literature is always hard to resist. Overall, I think <em>Emma</em> made for great entertainment and was a fun book to read.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion: The Best Book of 2016</strong></p>

<p>Even after writing all of this, I am still unsure. I think <em>Waiting</em> had more personal impact whereas <em>Emma</em> was a pleasure to lay my eyes on. I read stories to experience things that I wouldn&rsquo;t have otherwise. I read to be entertained, to think deeply, to feel, and to find bits of myself. Both of these books have hits and misses in this regard. Overall, I think I just might have to give the best book of 2016 to Ha Jin&rsquo;s <em>Waiting</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is everyday a reading day for you? Submitted by Elizabeth @ <a href="​http://silversolara.blogspot.com/">Silver&rsquo;s Reviews</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m trying to make it a habit of reading everyday. Realistically though, I only really read during the work week. Those days I specifically block out times for myself dedicated for reading: on the way to and from work (since I take public transportation). One day I&rsquo;d like to read everyday, but I still have a way to go.</p>

        <h4>Jan 7, 2017 | <a href="http://edelgrace.me/websites/phew-i-moved-my-fanlistings/#disqus_thread">Comments</a></h4>
        
        <div class="tags">
            <ul>
              
              <li><a href="/categories/websites">Websites</a></li>            
              
  
              
              <li><a href="/tags/fanlistings">#fanlistings</a></li>
              
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Fanlistings are basically the early 2000&rsquo;s version of Facebook pages. I <a href="http://fan.edelgrace.me">own a bunch of them</a>, mostly of songs or video game characters. Honestly, the whole fanlisting thing has been going down in popularity as the years go by. It&rsquo;s a bit sad. Fanlistings come and go a lot. There&rsquo;s a high turnover rate. I try my best to maintain and keep mine up and running.</p>

<p>However, my old domain name expired and I had trouble getting in touch with my registrar to renew it. I really loved that domain name because it featured my frequently used user handle but I determined it to be a lost cause and ultimately let it go. Since GitHub introduced the student pack which included a .me domain for free for one year, I claimed it. Hence, <em>edelgrace.me</em> was born.</p>

<p>Right now I&rsquo;m using $50 credit from <a href="https://m.do.co/c/999dd787b62c">Digital Ocean</a> (yes, that is a referral link) for an Ubuntu droplet. However, it only runs on 512MB RAM so I opted to buy a cheap 1GB RAM server from <a href="http://ramnode.com">RamNode</a> (no, that is actually not a referral link). 512MB RAM would probably be enough for me since I don&rsquo;t receive many visits to my websites but you never know what the future might bring.</p>

<p>So on the event of my domain expiring, I moved all of my fanlistings over to the RamNode server. I exported a SQL file through phpMyAdmin from my website to recreate the database and ran it on the server. Since I wanted better naming conventions, I had to change all the config files in order to connect to the database. There were some issues that I had to plow through in Enthusiast, one being that the absolute path to the fanlisting script needed to be changed. Since I&rsquo;m no longer of thinking of sticking to hosting but rather maintaining my own servers, I don&rsquo;t think I should have to worry about changing the path ever again.</p>

<p>Afterwards, I had to contact <a href="http://thefanlistings.org">The Fanlisting Network</a> (TFL) in order to change my URLs. The network is to ensure that duplicate fanlistings don&rsquo;t exist. In theory, duplicate fanlistings can exist but the ones listed on TFL are more trusted.</p>

<p>In summary, that was my evening last night. It took up more time than I wanted but that&rsquo;s okay. I still managed to get some studying for CCNA done so all went well.</p>

<p>Where&rsquo;s your favourite place to read? Submitted by Ronyell @ <a href="http://rabbitearsbookblog.blogspot.com/">Rabbit Ears Book Blog</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I will be honest&#8230; I don&rsquo;t think I have a favourite place, as long as I&rsquo;m reading. In terms of places where I usually read is on the bus or when I&rsquo;m eating. I wish I had a better place to read, it&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve sat down in a dedicated spot for reading at home.</p>

        <p>Today I learned about IGMP, which stands for Internet Group Message Protocol. There are three different ways packets are sent out to other devices. There&rsquo;s unicast, which just sends a packet to one specific device. Then there&rsquo;s broadcast, which sends packets to all the devices that is in the network. Lastly, there&rsquo;s multicast. Multicast sends packets to more than one device but not all the devices.</p>

<p>If a device wants to be part of a multicast group, it sends out an IGMP packet, or more specifically, an IGMP join packet. The join packet expresses the device&rsquo;s desire to subscribe to the multicast feed.</p>

<p>Usually, a switch is the receiving end of this join request. If IGMP snooping is enabled on the switch, it will listen for requests and add the device to the group.</p>
