<h3 id="day-21-rest-day">Day 21: Rest Day</h3>

<p>Today was a much needed rest day. Lately I&rsquo;ve been having the tendency to fall asleep as soon as I get home, which sucks. So I decided to just sleep, haha! I didn&rsquo;t try out the pizza. Maybe one day. Seriously, one day I will try all of her recipes!</p>

<h3 id="day-19-total-body">Day 19: Total Body</h3>

<p>I got home today after writing a midterm and I was so tired that I was tempted to just not do the workout today but then I realized tomorrow os rest day and who wants to work out on rest day? Not me. So I decided against it and got off my butt to do it. And I&rsquo;m glad I did because today was so much easier!</p>

<h3 id="video-1-butt-lift-and-slim-thighs">Video 1: Butt Lift and Slim Thighs</h3>

<p>I did this workout yesterday because I was bored and yay I get to do it again! This is a very easy video but the burn is definitely there.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Straight Leg Pulse:</em> By far the easiest move. Cassey doesn&rsquo;t keep you going long enough for it to hurt.</li>
<li><em>Fire Hydrant and Fire Hydrant Kick:</em> These definitely got tiresome especially when the kick was added but the burn felt amazing.</li>
<li><em>Sexy Dancer Kicks:</em> A very simple move. You really have to focus on tending your legs and moving slowly and deliberately to feel something.</li>
<li><em>Hot Potato:</em> Another easy move to do and to feel the burn. I struggled with the pacing a bit because I didn&rsquo;t want to tap on the floor too loud and wake my parents up.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-2-fat-destroyer">Video 2: Fat Destroyer</h3>

<p>My heart was really pumping for this video! At the risk of repeating myself, this is hard to do quietly.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Squat Tap:</em> I didn&rsquo;t do the jump associated with this but I did make sure to squat as low as possible.</li>
<li><em>Lunge to High Kick:</em> I lost my balance easily with this one, haha!</li>
<li><em>Plank Walk Opener:</em> A fun move that kind of slowed down the pace but not too much.</li>
<li><em>Plank Jack:</em> Had to substitute this one with a quieter version but even that was difficult.</li>
<li><em>Mountain Climber and Wide Mountain Climber:</em> The wide climber was LOUD but I managed to do the normal version well.</li>
<li><em>Pile Hops:</em> Another one I couldn&rsquo;t do with the jump, I just focused on squatting as low as possible.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-3-upper-back-and-leg-stretches">Video 3: Upper Back and Leg Stretches</h3>

<p>Really great stretches for the legs, my problem area. It requires the usage of a belt or a long strap. You really get a stretch out of this one!</p>

<h3 id="day-19-abs">Day 19: Abs</h3>

<p>I loathe ab days. They&rsquo;re really hard and not that fun, haha. But I really do feel the burn the most on these days. I need to work on this&#8230;</p>

<h3 id="video-1-fun-indoor-cardio-workout">Video 1: Fun Indoor Cardio Workout</h3>

<p>There are A LOT of kicks in this video. I did my workout in the morning today so I had to do some modifications, as always. I would love for Cassey to do a low impact cardio video one day!</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="video-2-lower-belly-flattener">Video 2: Lower Belly Flattener</h3>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Hundred:</em> I hate the hundred. So much! But today I was able to do it from start to finish, I think. Or at least, mostly from start to finish. I hated every second of it though.</li>
<li><em>Double Leg Stretch:</em> This was kind of a fun move if it didn&rsquo;t hurt my neck so much. My neck always hurts whenever we do these ab exercises&#8230; Ugh!</li>
<li><em>Barbie Feet:</em> I felt a little cute doing this move, haha! But don&rsquo;t let the cuteness fool you, it&rsquo;s a bit hard. My legs were definitely getting tired.</li>
<li><em>Reverse Crunch:</em> These got my heart pumping! I liked doing these a lot AND I could feel the burn. My butt kind of hurt afterwards though.</li>
<li><em>1-2-3 Crunch:</em> Another hard move&#8230; The crunch is what got me. I have enough trouble doing it without the crunch!</li>
<li><em>Heel Clicks:</em> In hindsight, this is a really easy move but doing it back to back with other moves where I have to lift my shoulders makes it harder than usual!</li>
<li><em>See Saw Abs:</em> I. Could. Not. Do. These! Not to save my life. So I just opted for reverse crunches during this move.</li>
<li><em>Helicopters:</em> A really nice and easy move! It&rsquo;s fun watching Cassey do it. Not as fun actually doing it but there&rsquo;s still some fun in it.</li>
<li><em>Corkscrew:</em> I had a lot of trouble doing these with straight legs but I managed to kind of do them with bent legs. My butt hurt.</li>
<li><em>Single Leg Drop:</em> A nice easy way to end the video. And it seemed like it lasted for only a couple of seconds!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-3-4-minutes-to-flat-abs-and-toned-thighs">Video 3: 4 Minutes to Flat Abs and Toned Thighs</h3>

<p>This video is essentially two moves so I won&rsquo;t bother listing them. The moves were hard! I kept hearing clicking and cracking noises and it kind of worried me a bit. Still, this was really hard! I had to pause the video a couple of time to catch a breather.</p>

<h3 id="day-18-lower-body">Day 18: Lower Body</h3>

<p>Because I had to make up day 17 today, I broke the two workouts up throughout the day. But near the end of the day, I just did the last two videos all at once. This day&rsquo;s workout is surprisingly not that bad. I didn&rsquo;t have any trouble with the moves today which was&#8230; Weird but satisfying.</p>

<h3 id="video-1-pumped-up-cardio-warmup">Video 1: Pumped Up Cardio Warmup</h3>

<p>I really like her cardio warmups! The only downside is that they are so loud! They&rsquo;re fun but I do have to make some slight modifications to be a little more quieter.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="video-2-beginner-inner-thighs">Video 2: Beginner Inner Thighs</h3>

<p>This video was a lot more easier this time! It seems like every time a video pops up again for the second or third time, it gets easier. Which is great! I must be making some sort of progress then. I still love that one girl in purple shorts who keeps smiling. She&rsquo;s so cute!</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="video-3-stretching-for-flexibility">Video 3: Stretching for Flexibility</h3>

<p>If I recall correctly, Cassey doesn&rsquo;t really name the moves in this video so I won&rsquo;t list them. They&rsquo;re all pretty basic moves which were easy to do. Except for the bridge. I was not flexible enough to do the bridge! I tried to rest my head on the floor but head just ended up hurting. Maybe next time!</p>

<h3 id="day-17-total-body">Day 17: Total Body</h3>

<p>Okay, this is the first time I have skipped a day and had to make it up. I didn&rsquo;t feel too guilty about skipping yesterday because I had spin class, which is two (maybe even three) times as long and 234204398 times harder than these workouts. I enjoy spin class though, don&rsquo;t get me wrong! It&rsquo;s the only &ldquo;real&rdquo; cardio I do, unless you count Cassey&rsquo;s occasional four minute cardio videos. Also, I brisquely walked around for an hour. I was craving food and the cheapest and least caloric food is Wendy&rsquo;s (I love their $2 small chilies) which is quite a walk away and I had to get to class on time so I sped walk there and back. So yeah, the guilt was basically non-existent. I got home, ate supper, and literally went to bed at 8 and fell asleep around 9. I was pooped for some reason!</p>

<p>Anyway, overall, this &ldquo;day&rdquo; was pretty okay. A couple of hard moves but I think I can feel myself getting stronger and being more capable of performing everything. Not to say that I don&rsquo;t occasionally pause the video anymore, but I can feel it getting easier.</p>

<h3 id="video-1-fat-burning-cardio-warmup">Video 1: Fat Burning Cardio Warmup</h3>

<p>What I like about this video is that it&rsquo;s relatively quiet. I got up at 6 this morning and did these exercises as quietly as possible and was still able to get my heart rate up and my skin sweating! Since I&rsquo;ve done this warmup before, I won&rsquo;t describe all the moves. I can&rsquo;t really pick a favourite one or a least favourite one. I guess I don&rsquo;t really understand the squat curl. Like on a philosophical level. Did that make sense?</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="video-2-5-best-exercises-to-flatten-your-lower-belly">Video 2: 5 Best Exercises to Flatten Your Lower Belly</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Best exercises,&rdquo; okay. I really need this video in my life, probably. I&rsquo;ve been trying to flatten my belly for years and ultimately, this is what my fitness kick is trying to accomplish! Also, I do not recommend abs/belly exercises right after you eat a big meal. Do not do it.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Double Leg Lift:</em> Cassey really loves her double leg lifts! I think I&rsquo;ve gotten used to them. This move can go on forever though.</li>
<li><em>Reverse Crunch:</em> Okay, this move was interesting. I did enjoy it a bit but it kind of hurt on my way down.</li>
<li><em>Heel Clicks:</em> Ridiculously simple but it gets tiring really easily! I tried my best to go as low as I could but darn, it gets harder as you get lower!</li>
<li><em>Cheerleader L&rsquo;s:</em> I hate this one! It&rsquo;s pretty hard for me to keep my balance and keep my shoulders off the mat. Not going to lie, I had to resort to the beginner&rsquo;s modification.</li>
<li><em>Rocket:</em> The rocket was also hard. This one hurt a lot. It felt like my shoulders were digging into the ground. I probably just need practice.</li>

<p>With &ldquo;massacre&rdquo; in the title, I really was expecting worse. But I didn&rsquo;t get it! Which was surprising. For some reason I wondered why a lot of these moves were targeted to muffin tops&#8230; I don&rsquo;t even know if I have muffin tops.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Elegant Candlestick:</em> This was a pretty good move. It felt like a stretch more than anything. I really pictured the candlestick from &ldquo;Beauty and the Beast&rdquo; while doing this move.</li>
<li><em>Truck Drivers:</em> Another pretty good move! I love the truck driver analogy. It did get tiring but I didn&rsquo;t feel it as much as the other moves. The burn was less but it totally drained some of my stamina.</li>
<li><em>Caressing Side Squeezers:</em> This was hard but I mostly made it through! Lifting myself up is the hardest part about this move, which is basically what the move is. So the hardest part was the entire thing.</li>
<li><em>Obliquatories and Flexed Obliquatories:</em> Keeping my lower leg lifted proved to be a challenge so I just kept it on the floor for most of the move. My legs definitely hurt more than whatever this move was supposed to work. Also, I&rsquo;m not sure if the name of the move is a pun or not but I approve.</li>
