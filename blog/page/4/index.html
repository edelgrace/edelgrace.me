<p>Over the weekend I went to Drumheller with the family. Up to this point I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to go on a long road trip with my crochet. I started this ripple afghan a couple of days ago with Bernat Blanket Stripes yarn. This blanket is intended for my cousins&rsquo;s newborn son. I guess he isn&rsquo;t quite so newborn now but every baby could use a blanket regardless! I actually restarted this blanket once or twice but I finally got the hang of it while on this trip.</p>

<p>The drive to Drumheller from Calgary isn&rsquo;t completely long, just under two hours, but I managed to get a decent amount of rows done. It was a very relaxing and productive way to spend my time other than just sleeping. I have to admit, there were times when I felt sleepy enough to pass out but I kept through with it! It didn&rsquo;t help that it was lightly raining at one point as well. But I plugged in my headphones and played a little bit of The Strokes and some Utada to keep me awake.</p>

        <p>Honestly, Stampede is synonymous with food for me. Stampede means free breakfasts for a week. Usually these breakfasts consists of pancakes and sausages. We ended up going to six of these breakfasts. Some of them were worth it, some of them weren&rsquo;t. One of them actually ended up being $250 because my brother got fined for forgetting to validate his train ticket on the way to a breakfast. But still, a lot of pancakey goodness!</p>

<p>Since I was babysitting my cousin, we didn&rsquo;t go to any stampede breakfasts since they required some travel. Instead, I cooked them up homemade stampede breakfast! Basically just Eggo waffles, bacon, and eggs. Instead of maple syrup, I just made some strawberry sugar spread.</p>

<p>Okay I thought I didn&rsquo;t want to go to the Stampede this year but I did end up going with my cousin, brother, and mom. We just went for two hours. We ate a lot of food and bought home lottery tickets.</p>

<p>The different foods we tried were:</p>

<p><strong>Reuben Corndogs</strong></p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t take any pictures but this was a bit of a disappointment. A hotdog wrapped in one slice of Swiss cheese then covered with corn flour. I was hoping for more cheese but it under-delivered.</p>

<p><strong>Fried Cheese Sticks</strong></p>

<p>Oh. My. Goodness. I fell in love with these sticks. I cannot resist anything deep fried. All this cheese definitely made up for the lack of cheese in the corndogs. We bought cheddar and mozzarella sticks. The cheddar was full of flavour and very sharp. However the mozzarella was full of gooey goodness and was a lot more fried. I loved them both!</p>

<p><strong>Deep Fried Cheesecake</strong></p>

<p>I am a cheesecake lover. I have said this for years but cheesecake is the way to my heart. Deep fried cheesecake wasn&rsquo;t on my radar until my brother pointed it out and I knew immediately that I had to try it. It was pretty yummy but basically a cheesecake wrapped in a pastry and then fried. It fell a little short of my expectations but was still super yummy!</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Topics of sexuality, religion, and spoilers for the book is mentioned in this blog post.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A revelatory novel about being queer and Muslim, set in war-torn Iraq in 2003. Ramy is a young gay Iraqi struggling to find a balance between his sexuality, religion, and culture. Ammar is a sheikh whose guidance Ramy seeks, and whose tolerance is tested by his belief in the teachings of the Qur&rsquo;an. Full of quiet moments of beauty and raw depictions of violence, God in Pink poignantly captures the anguish and the fortitude of Islamic life in Iraq.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With a lot of things going on nowadays in Iraq and surrounding countries, I find myself becoming a little more interested in the lives of a typical Muslim. I understand that being queer and Muslim isn&rsquo;t exactly &ldquo;typical&rdquo; but it was a topic I&rsquo;m drawn to being queer and somewhat religious myself. Namir takes a very different take on this scenario than from what I expected. This little novel takes on the perspectives of Ramy, a gay man wanting to find a way through being gay in Muslim society, and Sheikh Ammar is a preacher who does not not to even entertain the idea of homosexuality.</p>

<p>Although in his mid-twenties, Ramy seems to me like a young teenager. He is full of passion, extremely rash, idealistic, but also a little hesitant to fully break free. He falls for men somewhat fast and extremely hard. Although he longs for freedom, he sees around him in the closeted gay community full of hypocrisy and tragedy. His family keeps pushing for marriage not just because it&rsquo;s expected but because on some level, they know Ramy is gay and they want to either help him keep it a secret or to convince themselves that he&rsquo;s actually straight and not gay. While his whirlwind and bloody romances are expected, what&rsquo;s not so expected is the supernatural twist Namir puts to this tale.</p>

<p>Sheikh Ammar begins to have hallucinations of a pink cherub, Angel Gabriel, and a woman donned in a Burqa, Abaddon. They act as opposite sides of his conscious. Angel Gabriel is gay and encourages Ammar to accept Ramy in all of his glorious gayness whereas Abaddon points out the Islamic teachings that say otherwise. This supernatural twist was something that seemed almost left field for me. I did not expect it. I can&rsquo;t say for sure if I like it or not. I feel like I wouldn&rsquo;t be missing out on much if Ammar&rsquo;s storyline was cut out completely. I do like the turn Namir takes with Ammar however. In the end, Ammar turns to cross dressing and pretty much renounces his religion completely.</p>

<p>Overall, it seemed a bit of a rollercoaster going from one storyline to another. The moments when they intersected were disappointing. Both main characters had their moments of ridiculousness for me. What disappointed me the most was how little of Ramy&rsquo;s life after marriage panned out. I&rsquo;m not disappointed that the marriage happened because it is realistic, I could totally see it happening. But Namir got me invested in Jameela and I felt a twinge of sympathy for her marrying a man who could not love her as fully as a man who was interested in women was.</p>

<p>Somehow though, I liked it. It was quirky and a little fun. It wasn&rsquo;t as serious as I thought it would be but I think adding the tinge of dreamy-like aspects made it a more enjoyable read.</p>

        <p>While I&rsquo;m still looking for a job this summer (which is almost halfway over already&#8230; Blah!) I took a cue from Y who started to work on some side projects and I decided to be a little more productive. Since I have a free month of Udacity from the GitHub <a href="http://education.github.com/pack">Student Pack</a>. Udacity is basically an online learning hub where you can take courses that are related to the tech field.</p>

<p>Since I am an aspiring full stack web developer, I decided to go with the appropriately named, &ldquo;Full Stack Developer&rdquo; Nanodegree. I am probably around 20% completed the degree and it&rsquo;s been pretty much a week since I started.</p>

<p>So far I have done some basic Python programming and responsive web development. I didn&rsquo;t learn much with the Python programming part because it was all very basic and I&rsquo;ve done a lot of Python programming. Basically I made a movie trailer website that is composed of static web pages generated with Python. The web pages are composed of movie trailers that are pulled from <a href="http://www.themoviedb.com">The Movie DB</a> using their API. You can check out an example <a href="http://fan.edelgrace.me/fsdn01/Edel's_Favourite_Movies.html">here</a> or take a look at it on <a href="https://github.com/edelgrace/fsdn01-movie-trailer-website">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Right now I&rsquo;m working on a responsive web design. It&rsquo;s taking a little bit more time because I&rsquo;ve been busy the past couple of days. I had my first counselling appointment with a new counsellor, went to some Stampede breakfasts, and hung out with family and Y. But I think I&rsquo;m pretty much done it all except for making sure everything complies with Udacity&rsquo;s style guides. I keep tripping up on them wanting `` being lowercase instead. It&rsquo;s hard to break old habits.</p>

<p>One thing I really like about their format is that there are a lot of videos. That way I can take my time to weave in ends for my temperature blanket that I&rsquo;m working on. July is turning out to be a rollercoaster for weather. I had my first solid colour square the other day. It was pretty rainy on that day which explains why it was so much cooler. Now the rain spell has mostly ended and we&rsquo;re back to low 30s weather. I don&rsquo;t know which I prefer the most&#8230;</p>

<p>After making my <a href="http://edelgrace.me/blog/crochet/fo-5-my-first-granny-square/">first granny square</a>, I quickly made my second granny square. Both were made from Loop &amp; Threads yarn of the wool variety. I can&rsquo;t remember the exact name of the yarn.</p>

<p>I am not quite sure about the colour choices but they were the colours I had on hand of the same yarn. It is better than my previous one in that it uses more than two colours. I have been crocheting for a couple of months now but I am still intimidated with colour changes. Eventually I want to work my way into making a really pretty piece with different colours that all fit together!</p>
