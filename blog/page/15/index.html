        <p>As you may have noticed, I recently took up learning how to crochet. Since March is National Crochet Month, &nbsp;I decided to take part in some of the activities that are being held at Ravelry.</p>

<p><strong>MCAL (Mystery Crochet Along)</strong></p>

<p>This is an event that reveals the pattern slowly, clue by clue. The only hint is that it&rsquo;s an anigurumi made out of three colours. This will be my first amigurumi so I&rsquo;m quite excited but also anxious that it won&rsquo;t turn out well.</p>

<p><strong>Team Catghan</strong></p>

<p>There is one CAL aimed at making items for donation. I decided to make cat rugs as they seemed to be the easiest of the bunch.</p>

<p><strong>Bag CAL</strong></p>

<p>This CAL is pretty simple, just crochet a bag! Any bag, really. I am not sure what kind of bag I want to make. I did see one pattern that is easy but it&rsquo;s made entirely of single crochets. A little boring but it&rsquo;s doable.</p>

        <h4>Feb 28, 2017 | <a href="http://edelgrace.me/crochet/crochet-haul-2-cheap-crochet-set/#disqus_thread">Comments</a></h4>

        </div>

        <p>Since I&rsquo;m just starting out with crocheting, I bought a somewhat cheap crochet set on Amazon. I&rsquo;m hesitant to buy high end luxury tools if I&rsquo;m not even sure I want to continue crocheting. I do think it would be a worthy hobby to take part in!</p>

<p>The case itself is seriously cute. The brand seems to be <em>Merrywindix</em> but I can&rsquo;t quite tell. It&rsquo;s a lot smaller than I expected which is great, that means it&rsquo;s extremely portable.</p>

<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/edelgrace.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wp-image-336610788jpeg.jpeg"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/edelgrace.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wp-image-336610788jpeg.jpeg?resize=663%2C373" alt="" class="wp-image-252 alignnone size-full"  data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>Once you open the case, the crochet hooks and a gauge are all laid out neatly and in the middle is a detachable pouch containing smaller items.</p>

<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/edelgrace.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wp-image-1340625252jpeg.jpeg"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/edelgrace.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wp-image-1340625252jpeg.jpeg?resize=663%2C373" alt="" class="wp-image-254 alignnone size-full"  data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>Here is the open case with the pouch removed, if you so choose.</p>

<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/edelgrace.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wp-image-468931543jpeg.jpeg"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/edelgrace.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wp-image-468931543jpeg.jpeg?resize=663%2C373" alt="" class="wp-image-255 alignnone size-full"  data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>Inside the removable pouch there are a couple of useful items such as stitch markers, foldable scissors, a magnifying glass (how cute!), measuring tape, yarn needles, and two contraptions I don&rsquo;t know what they are quite yet.</p>

<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/edelgrace.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wp-image-379559443jpeg.jpeg"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/edelgrace.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wp-image-379559443jpeg.jpeg?resize=663%2C373" alt="" class="wp-image-256 alignnone size-full"  data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>If you need to know any additional information about the case, let me know! I know I&rsquo;m looking forward to using it.</p>

        <p>The fine folks at <a hre="http://www.skacelknitting.com">Skacel Knitting</a> are hosting a series they call &ldquo;<a href="http://www.crochetalongtogether.com/">Crochet Along Together</a>&rdquo; or &ldquo;CAT&rdquo; for short. They post videos throughout the month to walk you through the project. A draw is also held after the project is finished.</p>

<p><strong>March CAT</strong></p>

<p>This is their very first installment and is geared towards (but not limited to) beginners to crochet. The project for this months is the <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/easy-as-1-2-3-cowl">Easy As 1-2-3 Cowl</a> which is a three colour cowl.</p>

<p><strong>Supplies</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>3 skeins of HiKoo &reg; Simplicity yarn each different colours</li>
<li>1 4mm corchet hook (size F in addi&reg; or size G in other brands)</li>
<li>1 locking stitch marker</li>
<li>1 darning/tapestry needle</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why I&rsquo;m joining</strong></p>

<p>This is perfect timing for me to enter the crochet world. I had been interested in crochet for a couple of months after my SO received a cute crocheted Yoshi as a present and after seeing a couple of people busting out their crochet hooks in lectures. This definitely goes with my &ldquo;find a hobby&rdquo; quest that I have for myself. My SO actually suggested I try knitting but I was a little more drawn to the cute crocheted toys that I so often see. In general, I like how crochet results in something a little more concrete and physical. It seems like a good way to keep my hands busy and give some trinkets to family, friends, and people in need.</p>

Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week&rsquo;s question is&#8230;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How do you feel about books with multiple narrators? Submitted by Eli @ <a href="http://thebooksupplier.com/">The Book Supplier</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I definitely don&rsquo;t mind them nor do I have a preference towards them. My opinion isn&rsquo;t fresh as I haven&rsquo;t read a book with multiple narrators in a long time. The only ones that stand out in my mind are <em>Flipped</em> by Wendelin Van Draanen and Jodi Picoult&rsquo;s <em>Songs of the Humpback Whale</em>. The former was done pretty well and I enjoyed the he-said she-said style. The latter, however, got a tad too confusing with it&rsquo;s multiple narrators although it did get me incredibly invested in the story.</p>

<p>In summary, I don&rsquo;t have any complaints as long as it does not detract from the overall reading experience. As long as I can remember who&rsquo;s who, I can probably get through it.</p>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>I finally got to watch <em>Arrival</em> the other day. It wasn&rsquo;t exactly everything that I expected but I think I wasn&rsquo;t displeased with the twist.</p>

<p>The fist half of the movie follows Louise, a professor who specializes in languages and translations. She is recruited by the government to help translate the language of aliens who had touched down on earth. Together with a mathematician, Ian, they slowly learn the writing system of the aliens.</p>

<p>At the climax, the aliens are at risk of being attacked by multiple countries around the world. This is when it is revealed that Louise can experience the future. She uses her glimpses of the future to piece together how exactly she had to prevent the attack on the aliens.</p>

<p>Throughout the movie, Louise had been seeing visions of her child. I initially thought these were flashbacks from the past and that the stress of sleepless nights had resurfaced painful memories for Louise. What was really happening was that Louise had been experiencing the future and the present simultaneously.</p>

<p>Louise marries her partner Ian and have a child together and that child is the one Louise had seen in her episodes into the future. While still in the present, Louise experiences multiple memories with her daughter Hannah and eventually learns that Hannah has an incurable disease that causes her to die in her teens.</p>

<p>This part of the movie caused great confusion for my SO and I.</p>

<p>If Louise knew that her daughter would have to suffer and die early, why did she choose to have her at all?</p>

<p>One of the arguments that I think is the most forgivable is that Louise is not able to control the outcome of her future, despite being able to see it. That is, her future is predetermined and she can&rsquo;t change her future no matter what. So it doesn&rsquo;t really matter that she knows what&rsquo;s going to happen if she can&rsquo;t change it.</p>

<p>A counter argument is that when she experiences the future, it is happening and she can make choices. There is hard evidence in the movie that supports this argument. When Louise is talking to her daughter at the lake, she asks her what day it is because she isn&rsquo;t sure that what is happening is real or just a vision. Another scenario is when she is trying to think of a term for her daughter and it isn&rsquo;t until she hears someone say it in the present that she can tell her daughter the term in the future.</p>

<p>In terms of morality, I have mixed feelings. Is it immoral of Louise to bring her daughter into the world if she knew her daughter would suffer? It&rsquo;s a touchy subject and I cannot come to a complete decision on the topic.</p>

<p>On one hand, I&rsquo;m a firm believer of &ldquo;it&rsquo;s better to have loved and lost than to not love at all.&rdquo; As a result of knowing Hannah&rsquo;s future, Louise is able to cherish each and every moment with her daughter. She loves Hannah with ever fiber of her being. Who&rsquo;s to say that Hannah&rsquo;s happier years weren&rsquo;t worth it?</p>

<p>While I also believe in a women&rsquo;s choice to do whatever she wants with her body, this situation is different because her actions absolutely impacts another person&rsquo;s life negatively. It&rsquo;s unfair that someone so young and just beginning her life would have it cut short. Some people might say it is cruel and irresponsible for Louise to bring her daughter into the world.</p>

<p>I really don&rsquo;t know what to think of it but I keep turning it over in my mind. Louise doesn&rsquo;t really have a rare circumstance. Some people have genetic disorders that can be passed down to their own kids. They have to choose whether or not they want to have kids or not. Some find out about a condition while the child is not yet born and they are faced with the same decision.</p>

<p>Is it up to the parents? Do some situations call for different actions or is there a universally ethical way of handling it? I don&rsquo;t know myself. I hope I don&rsquo;t have to choose and if I do, I hope I&rsquo;ll be confident in my answer.</p>
