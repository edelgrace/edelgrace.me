<p>Do you visit every listed blog in the linky list when you are participating in a meme? Submitted by Elizabeth @ <a href="http://silversolara.blogspot.com/">Silver&rsquo;s Reviews</a></p>

<p>I try to! But I don&rsquo;t always manage to do so. I usually do my blog hopping on the train to/from work. I should probably put more effort into trying to visit everyone. I also don&rsquo;t really check the linky past Friday, even though it&rsquo;s a week long event.</p>

        <p>I decided to make a baby blanket for my cousin who is due in June. I bought a ton of Bernat Blanket skeins for this project. There is a big sale going on at Michael&rsquo;s so I kept getting discount after discount. Which is good because I could never imagine buying this many skeins of Bernat Blanket at full price. I may have actually bought too many. I did buy one skein at Walmart though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have been awakened.</p>

<p>Floppy disk inserted, computer turned on, a whirring, and then this sentence, followed by a blinking cursor. So begins Suspended, the first computer game to obsess seven-year-old Michael, to worm into his head and change his sense of reality. Thirty years later he will write: &ldquo;Computer games have taught me the things you can&rsquo;t learn from people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gamelife is the memoir of a childhood transformed by technology. Afternoons spent gazing at pixelated maps and mazes train Michael&rsquo;s eyes for the uncanny side of 1980s suburban Illinois. A game about pirates yields clues to the drama of cafeteria politics and locker-room hazing. And in the year of his parents&rsquo; divorce, a spaceflight simulator opens a hole in reality.</p>

<p>In telling the story of his youth through seven computer games, Michael W. Clune captures the part of childhood we live alone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m always intrigued about what people have to say about video games. What I find even more intriguing is how video games impact people&rsquo;s lives. More often than not, most video game memoirs (that I have read) involve the awkward geek entering into the beginning of the video game era. They find themselves or find a way out of themselves with this exciting new piece of technology by playing their way through <em>Wolfenstein</em>, <em>Doom</em>, <em>Ultima</em>, <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Michael Clune&rsquo;s <em>Gamelife</em> is no exception to this template. What unique offerings he has are in the form of metaphors and a somewhat serious video game addiction. At times, it feels like Clune&rsquo;s metaphors and observations are a bit of a stretch. It&rsquo;s almost like he tries to find meaning in something that doesn&rsquo;t have any meaning at all (i.e. <sky quote>). Other times, he&rsquo;s awfully poetic.</p>

<p>There were points where I assumed the role of his mother. I, too, worried about Clune&rsquo;s empty social life. But I also knew too well the unreasonably cruel ways that kids operated.</p>

<p>Okay, I didn&rsquo;t really. I had a good group of friends that I grew up with. However, I never felt as inside of the group as I thought I should be. Like Michael, I saw my friends faces close off mid-laugh and their eyes suddenly go distant the moment I opened my mouth.</p>

<p>I, also like Michael, retreated into the world of video games but of the much milder sort. My addiction was Runescape and Club Penguin. I&rsquo;d build endless camp fires, bake bread, and pretend to be a penguin spy. I wasn&rsquo;t like Clune&rsquo;s classmate Evan, who was true to himself no matter what character appeared on his screen. Even when I did name a character after myself, I always played as the person who I used to be.</p>

<p>It was observations like these, the ones where I found myself in them, that made me really appreciate this book. However there was something about Clune&rsquo;s style of narration that didn&rsquo;t jive with me. Perhaps, I disliked Clune&rsquo;s portrayal of himself. There was no redemption moment for Clune and no real moments of growth.</p>

<p>Would I recommend this to someone? Yeah, I think it has value. The main reason why I didn&rsquo;t enjoy this as much as I could have is probably a matter of preference.</p>

        <p>I made this little bag mostly while playing the MMO <em>Blade &amp; Soul</em>, hence the title &ldquo;Perpetually Loading.&rdquo; My computer is a bit of a toaster so I managed to get a lot of crocheting done while on the loading screen. Sometimes my game would crash on the loading screen and that would mean even more crocheting for me! Unfortunately, this worked out to the disadvantage of my SO who I was playing with at the time.</p>

<p>This is my very first ever bag. I think it&rsquo;s pretty cute! I ran out of orange yarn so close to the end so I ended up having to use green for the last one and a half rows. I was so close but I lost the chicken yarn (starting a project with a partially used skein when you don&rsquo;t know if it will last the whole project).</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think I would ever use it but I am so happy with it! Now, what should I do with it?</p>

        </div>

        <p>One of the interns at my workplace suggested going painting as an activity that we could all do together. It seemed fun so we decided to give it a try! Paint Nite is a series of painting events held at bars, each session hosted by different people.</p>

<p>That day we went to <em>Yuk Yuk&rsquo;s Comedy Club</em> which is a few minutes walk from Victoria Park Stampede. We were really confused about the food since there was no (or incorrect) information on the website. The food there is actually pretty good but definitely not enough to fill you up. Take &ldquo;appetizers&rdquo; literally. We ordered chicken wings, potato skins,and nachos. The potato skins were absolutely delicious but only around 6 slices were made.</p>

<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/edelgrace.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wp-image-676443656jpg.jpg"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/edelgrace.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wp-image-676443656jpg.jpg?resize=663%2C1179" alt="" class="wp-image-370 alignnone size-full"  data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>The painting itself was a lot of fun! Our instructor that we had, Kim, was really patient, upbeat, and personable. She was certainly very energetic which I appreciated. Her instructions were extremely clear and I liked how she put a positive spin on everything.</p>

<p>What we were paitning was a moon looking over the ocean. It was fairly simple but we got the job done. This is was my painting ended up looking like at the end of it.</p>

<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/edelgrace.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wp-image-419509144jpg.jpg"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/edelgrace.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wp-image-419509144jpg.jpg?resize=663%2C1179" alt="" class="wp-image-371 alignnone size-full"  data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>All in all, it was a lot of fun! I would definitely go for another day. It is a little bit pricy, $45CAD before tax not including the food and drinks. Coupons are readily available however but do save this for a special ocassion!</p>
