<h3 id="day-6-total-body">Day 6: Total Body</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Wake up and do 15 crunches.&rdquo; I did four roll ups instead. And I never do these when I wake up, usually it&rsquo;s the last thing I do before bed. Not today though!</p>

<h3 id="video-1-cardio-warmup">Video 1: Cardio Warmup</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m really glad Cassey puts some cardio videos because most of her workouts are focusing on toning and my main goal is to burn fat and not really &ldquo;bulk&rdquo; up.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Pile Squat:</em> Thank goodness the first workout was relatively easy! It was kind of fun too.</li>
<li><em>Leg Kick:</em> These weren&rsquo;t bad either.</li>
<li><em>Jumping Jacks and Cross Jack:</em> I cheated a little because I didn&rsquo;t want to be too loud jumping all over the place.</li>
<li><em>Narrow Squat:</em> These were okay too! I felt weird doing this move, haha.</li>
<li><em>Lunges:</em> Lunges are okay. I&rsquo;m loving how easy the cardio is.</li>
<li><em>Walking Plank:</em> Planks are my weakness. I struggled with this even though it&rsquo;s pretty easy.</li>
<li><em>Dancing Dog:</em> These were harder after doing those planks but the burn definitely felt good, strangely.</li>
<li><em>Plank Walker Opener:</em> I could do these, but only at a slower pace. I felt the burn on this one too.</li>
<li><em>Walking Plank:</em> These was hard! Planks, like I said, are my worst moves.</li>
<li><em>Caterpillars:</em> This move is really fun! I kind of left out the push up at the end some times but I really liked this move.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-2-6-minutes-to-sexy-arms">Video 2: 6 Minutes to Sexy Arms</h3>

<p>Cassey wasn&rsquo;t lying when she said that girls don&rsquo;t really work out their arms. A lot of the comments on this video were (presumably females) complaining about how they didn&rsquo;t like how their arms were bulkier. Everyone wants to slim and not necessarily get muscly, haha!</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Arm Circles:</em> &ldquo;Arm circles of death&rdquo; is right. These are so hard after some time. Cassey is so perky during this workout and I couldn&rsquo;t stop swearing, haha. I wish I could have her attitude whenever I workout.</li>
<li><em>Pushers:</em> This looks easy but if you do it right (which I&rsquo;m pretty sure I did), it will BURN. Even Cassey comments on the burn that she feels. Arms are so hard to do!</li>
<li><em>Chest Press Pulse:</em> Why do these look so easy but are so hard to do?? I kept fighting the urge to open up my elbows in this video. Cassey switches it up with the frequency of the pulses which kind of keeps your mind off how much longer you have.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-3-9-steps-to-doing-the-splits">Video 3: 9 Steps to doing the Splits</h3>

<p>I don&rsquo;t really care to learn how to do the splits so I mostly skipped this video but did try some of the stretches here. Maybe I&rsquo;ll use them for my spin class!</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>Today was KILLER on the arms! And my upper body was super sore from yesterday as well. I think pain = progress? I&rsquo;m not sure. I&rsquo;m glad this workout was really hard but I still managed to do really well and push through most of the moves. I&rsquo;m really looking forward to rest day tomorrow!</p>

<p>Usually I do these around 11 pm but today I found myself with an hour and managed to do it once I got home from school. The whole week last week, I was off of school due to reading week so I had more than enough time to do these. I&rsquo;m a little worried that now school is starting back up again, I might be able to stay on track. I hope not! I might resort to doing half of the workout in the morning and half in the afternoon. We&rsquo;ll see what will happen.</p>

<h3 id="day-5-abs">Day 5: Abs</h3>

<p>Okay I switched up the preambles in the calendar because apparently I can&rsquo;t read. Day three I was supposed to plank for 30 seconds, yesterday I was supposed to do the burpees, and today I was supposed to drink an 8 oz of water. Whoops! So I compensated today by not only drinking the water but also doing the plank. I hate planks so much, they hurt! But no pain, no gain, I guess.</p>

<h3 id="video-1-total-body-workout">Video 1: Total Body Workout</h3>

<p>This video is the same video from the first day. Maybe it&rsquo;s meant as a confidence booster to show how much you&rsquo;ve progressed over the last five days.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Pilates stance:</em> I&rsquo;ll admit, I still struggle with this but it doesn&rsquo;t hurt as much and I can feel my abs working more.</li>
<li><em>Roll ups:</em> I love roll ups even though I can&rsquo;t 100% do them. I did ONE proper roll up without trying to support myself and it made so happy!.</li>
<li><em>Leg stuff:</em> This time around I did more of this without having to rest. Those pyramids are still tough but I can at least make it until that point without resting for a bit.</li>
<li><em>Cobra position:</em> My arms still hate these.</li>
<li><em>Elbow push ups:</em> Less sucky compared to last time but still sucky.</li>
<li><em>Mermaid stretches:</em> This move is so pretty and really easy! Nothing much has changed since the first time I did them.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-2-abs-and-butt-workout">Video 2: Abs and Butt Workout</h3>

<p>I love how Cassey keeps bringing on guests onto her videos so we don&rsquo;t get tired of her, haha. The guest this time is Rosanna from the YouTube channel Nerd Nummies. Makes sense, a chef should probably try their best to stay healthy. Ro is SO cute.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Scissors:</em> These were a pretty easy way to start off a workout, thank goodness! It definitely got my heart pumping.</li>
<li><em>One Leg Crunch:</em> Like Ro, I definitely had to do the easier variant of this move. Crunches/sit ups are so hard for me. I feel like I&rsquo;m continuously using my neck instead of my abs. How do I used my abs??</li>
<li><em>Roll ups:</em> Thank goodness for roll ups.</li>
<li><em>Balancing Pilates Stances:</em> Also like Ro, I totally struggled with this one. My sense of balance is really off.</li>
<li><em>Fire Hydrant:</em> This one got me tired really fast. My legs were on fire! But it&rsquo;s all for the butt so I guess it&rsquo;s okay.</li>
<li><em>Plank Twists:</em> Oh gosh this was hard for me! I kept collapsing to the floor. Planks are not my strong point. I&rsquo;ll probably have to work on that.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>My heart definitely got pumping in this workout! I was slightly disappointed how I wasn&rsquo;t able to do all of the first video flawlessly but I did feel some improvement. One day, I will get there. I really enjoyed Ro&rsquo;s prescence in the second video because it was a reminder that not everyone can get the moves right away 100% of the time. Sometimes I forget there are normal people like me doing these videos. I think today was really fun and I can&rsquo;t wait for tomorrow!</p>

        </div>

        <p>Okay, I know that probably isn&rsquo;t a lot compared to other bloggers out there but to me, that&rsquo;s mind blowing. 9 years is around 40% of my life and that percentage will only keep on increasing. Assuming that I continue blogging. As long as I can type, I don&rsquo;t think I would stop blogging. Sure, my blogging might be extremely sporadic but it&rsquo;s still blogging to me.</p>

<p>Actually, I was going through my archive and I read <a href="http://scattered.me/2007/02/bouncy/">a blog post</a> that was from exactly six years and two days ago. That&rsquo;s <strong>3289</strong> days ago. I laughed to myself abouut how some things just don&rsquo;t change.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t posted in a while.&rdquo;</em> This is me like every single time I post something. How is this still true even today? &ldquo;I need to post more,&rdquo; I say to myself every year.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too much of a perfectionist.&rdquo;</em> My second most fatal flaw. My first being that I&rsquo;m a procrastinator, which I&rsquo;m 99.9% sure that I was one back then. It&rsquo;s honestly the deadliest combination against productivity.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;My mom keeps complaining on how I’m &#8216;losing weight.&lsquo;&rdquo;</em> I literally got into a (civil) argument with my mom about my weight yesterday. I&rsquo;ve been trying to get toned (hence all the recent fitness posts) because I have always been conscious of my large gut. I&rsquo;m at a perfect weight for my height I just want to reduce my body fat percentage to get that flat stomach look. They say doing so is 80% diet and 20% exercise. I don&rsquo;t mind gaining weight through muscles.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Live performances always rekindle my love for a band.&rdquo;</em> Just recently I&rsquo;ve been <strong>obsessed</strong> with the post-hardcore Canadian band Alexisonfire. This was because, by some chance, I watched an hour long concert on YouTube of theirs from last year. It was mind blowing how perfect they were in that concert. I used to like Alexisonfire a lot when I was in junior high but watching this concert made my love for them grow tenfold. I never realized how great they were as a band.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;I am so tired right now.&rdquo;</em> They say nine years later that she is still tired today.</p>

<h3 id="day-4-lower-body">Day 4: Lower Body</h3>

<p>The little preamble for today in the calendar simply said to drink a glass of 8 oz of water. I have no idea what 8 oz looks like. Or how much any other measurements of liquids look like for that matter. So I just drank a regular glass of water.</p>

<p>I was definitely wondering why there was no simple warm up today and then I clicked to see the videos. There are <em>three</em> videos today. Oh. That&rsquo;s why!</p>

<h3 id="video-1-cardio-warm-up">Video 1: Cardio Warm Up</h3>

<p>This first video isn&rsquo;t exactly pilates but is something out of like a dance workout DVD. It&rsquo;s very high energy (it is cardio after all) and it totally got me sweating a little. There are no named moves in this workout, Cassey just speeds through them all, which is understandable.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="video-2-inner-thighs">Video 2: Inner Thighs</h3>

<p>This video is a bit of fun! Cassey lets a few of her fans come on screen for this session. On my first viewing of this video, I really inspected each of the fans in the background. It was a little bit relieving to see some more faces. There was this one girl who was absolutely adorable, she looked like she was struggling but she did it all with a smile on her face! She&rsquo;s laugh every single time she was straining, haha!</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Frogger:</em> I feel like I&rsquo;ve gotten better at holding my legs in midair! I definitely felt this one though.</li>
<li><em>Froggy Heel Kicks:</em> At first it seems really simple but legs got tired fast!</li>
<li><em>Frogger Heel Touch:</em> A variant of frogger, obviously. It&rsquo;s harder so I prefer plain old vanilla frogger.</li>
<li><em>Inner Thigh Side Raise:</em> This was hard! The position of the foot is a little weird and I slipped up a couple of times but when I didn&rsquo;t, I felt it.</li>
<li><em>Inner Thigh Lift:</em> Another hard move but not nearly as hard as the previous one. My legs tire easily apparently&#8230;</li>
<li><em>Pile Squat Pulses:</em> Squats make me nervous so I was not looking forward to this one. It actually wasn&rsquo;t as bad as I thought it would be!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-3-how-to-do-a-handstand">Video 3: How to do a Handstand</h3>

<p>I skipped this video as I&rsquo;m not really interested in doing a handstand. I&rsquo;m way too scared to try and attempt it! Maybe I should have done it but eh.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>I feel so accomplished, this was the first day where I didn&rsquo;t have to pause the video or take a couple seconds of rest during a move. I made it from start to finish! I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m getting used to it or if Cassey made this day deliberately easy like yesterday. I hope it&rsquo;s the former. I actually enjoy doing this when I can actually do it!</p>

<h3 id="day-3-total-body">Day 3: Total Body</h3>

<p>Today&rsquo;s workout starts off with 10 burpees. I will admit, I haven&rsquo;t done burpees since junior high school and I totally forgot how to do them. Unlike yesterday with the sit-ups, I didn&rsquo;t know how to do them at all. Like I had no notion of what a burpee was. So I had to look it up. Once I read the description, my junior high school gym classes suddenly came flooding back to me. I hated burpees back then and I still do now. In the end I opted for Fitness Blender&rsquo;s silent burpees because I&rsquo;m on the second floor and my parents were sleeping in the basement. Also it was almost midnight.</p>

<p>This video is around 9 minutes long and surprisingly only has three moves. There are a little more reps for each workout though, and that&rsquo;s for each leg.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Toe to ceiling pulse:</em> At first this started out easy but it got a little tiring near the end. I made it though!</li>
<li><em>Hammy curl:</em> This one I felt like I was on the verge of cramping up so I admit I did not clench as hard as I should have.</li>
<li><em>Grashopper:</em> I could not do these at all! It felt like I was doing them but my legs probably lifted maybe half a centimeter off the floor.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-2-total-body-workout-with-ana-caban">Video 2: Total Body Workout with Ana Caban</h3>

<p>In this video, Cassey brings on a guest Pilates instructor, Ana Caban. I&rsquo;m guessing Ana is big in the pilates world because Cassey was fangirling over her a bit. It was kind of cute to see! There isn&rsquo;t a big difference between Cassey and Ana other than Cassey is more talkative. Their moves are approximately around the same level.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Roll up:</em> I&rsquo;ve come to like roll ups a lot. Maybe it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s the only move I can do!</li>
<li><em>1 Legged Teaser Twist:</em> I just did these and I don&rsquo;t remember what they were&#8230; I had to rewatch the beginning of the video, haha. This move looks so graceful! I think this is one of the easier moves in this video.</li>
<li><em>Kneeling Side Series:</em> This is very similar to one of the moves from yesterday, I think (I don&rsquo;t remember which one exactly). It&rsquo;s not hard, it&rsquo;s just hard to resist giving up, haha! My legs tend to get tired easily doing moves like these.</li>
<li><em>Half Cobra Pushup:</em> Cassey herself said these were pretty simple but doing a lot of them in a row gets tough. Unfortunately, Casey doesn&rsquo;t exactly let it get to that point in the video.</li>
<li><em>Banana and Banana Teaser Twist:</em> It was really hard keeping my balance for these moves and because of that, I wasn&rsquo;t doing them properly. I felt zero tension in my body doing these.</li>
<li><em>Double Leg Lift:</em> This one was actually an okay move! When it comes to the pilates stance, my neck tends to hurt a lot. It&rsquo;s most likely because I&rsquo;m not doing it right and lifting with my neck and not my abs but I&rsquo;m not sure how to do that exactly.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>What I did differently today was watch the videos once or twice before actually starting the workout. I had to be somewhere really early in the morning and I didn&rsquo;t have time to do the workout then so I just downloaded the videos and watched them on my commute. When I got home later that evening, I made up the skeleton of this post, as I noted all the different exercises before hand. This was my second exposure to the workout. I splurged on food today so I didn&rsquo;t actually get to working out until late night since my stomach was so full for what felt like hours (I almost ate one pound of calories today, r.i.p. me).</p>

<p>This day I think was purposefully easier. Probably because Cassey (accurately) anticipated how sore my abs were from yesterday! It was a good boost in motivation.</p>

<p>The only downside is that I should not have had a glass of water literally minutes before starting this. My stomach felt full and uncomfortable throughout the whole thing but I wanted to get it done before midnight. Never again.</p>
