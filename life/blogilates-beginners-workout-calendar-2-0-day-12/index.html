<h3 id="day-12-abs">Day 12: Abs</h3>

<p>Ab workouts are so brutal&#8230; And, of course, that&rsquo;s what everyone wants to workout. Cue the suffering.</p>

<h3 id="video-1-ab-butt-workout">Video 1: Ab &amp; Butt Workout</h3>

<p>I seriously cannot get over how cute Rosanna is! She is absolutely adorable and when she struggles, I feel like I&rsquo;m not alone in ab hell. Somehow, she smiles through all of it! Workout goals&#8230;</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Scissors:</em> Literally the only easy workout in this video.</li>
<li><em>One Leg Crunch:</em> I still keep using my neck instead of my core to do these but it&rsquo;s so hard for me to lift up my shoulders still.</li>
<li><em>Roll ups:</em> Thank goodness for roll ups (again).</li>
<li><em>Balancing Pilates Stances:</em> Thankfully, I made a better attempt at this one compared to last week.</li>
<li><em>Fire Hydrant:</em> For the first time, I actually felt my butt working in this move&#8230; This was another move that was easier this time around!</li>
<li><em>Plank Twists:</em> Add this move to my &ldquo;Edel actually did it this time!&rdquo; list. I don&rsquo;t know what it was but they were easier this week. Although my feet kept pushing away the rug from my feet.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-2-abs-on-fire">Video 2: Abs on Fire</h3>

<p>Cassey was not joking about the title when she named this video &ldquo;abs on fire.&rdquo; My abs&#8230; Were definitely on fire.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Genie Abs:</em> These&#8230; were surprisingly okay! I&rsquo;m really bad at using my core. It wasn&rsquo;t until Cassey made it harder did I start to struggle a little.</li>
<li><em>Eagle Abs:</em> This move is very&#8230; Twisty! I suck at any variation of crunches so this was not a fun move. I don&rsquo;t think I did it right at all. I ended up just holding onto my knees whenever I went up.</li>
<li><em>Runaway Abs:</em> What a cute move. It was hard though because it always hurts to try to lift my shoulders off the floor. I could feel my shoulder blades digging into the ground.</li>
<li><em>Double Leg Stretch/Star Abs:</em> This was hard and I didn&rsquo;t have much room to do these properly. But I really tried to do these. Once again, once Cassey added a little more difficulty to the move, I tried it but just ended up doing the simple version again.</li>
<li><em>Clock Abs:</em> I do not like clock abs! I find it so hard to do and my hips go all over the place. But I tried my best, even if it was at a snail&rsquo;s pace.</li>
<li><em>Hollow Rock:</em> I could not do these very well! I kept sitting up all the way which is what is not what I was supposed to do, I&rsquo;m guessing.</li>
<li><em>Single Leg Drop:</em> You&rsquo;d think this move would be easy but I actually had some trouble with this one. But I pushed through it despite skipping some of the harder variations (completely by accident, I used my phone to watch this video and put it down without checking to see if anything changed).</li>
<li><em>Cheerleader L&rsquo;s:</em> There are two reasons why I was never a cheerleader. A) I have no flexibility or physical ability at all. B) We never had cheerleaders at my high school. So this move was really hard. I could barely do it. Actually, I couldn&rsquo;t do it! I just did it half-halfheartedly.</li>
<li><em>Earthquake:</em> Cassey said to expect shaking. Boy did the shaking happen. Every time Cassey said &ldquo;lower!&rdquo; I laughed and held my position. I did try to go as low as I could but it was not low enough at all.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-3-relax-with-me-stretch">Video 3: Relax with Me Stretch</h3>

<p>I was a little wary doing the stretches because on Friday I was stretching and gave myself a charley horse. The beach scenery was a nice touch. Typical California. I want sun too&#8230;</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Rise and Shine:</em> A move with almost no effort. Just a nice start to the stretching. I felt like a weird flower or something.</li>
<li><em>Side Bend Stretch:</em> Another easy move. My left side was feeling a little sore so I tried my best not to overdo it.</li>
<li><em>Half Rainbow Glute:</em> My left side was definitely not stretched out enough due to my soreness but my right side was feeling nice and taut!</li>
<li><em>Stretching Child/Mini Child Press:</em> Ramping up the difficulty just a tad bit. Presses are hard for me no matter what. But it was still relatively easy.</li>
<li><em>Down Dog:</em> This move actually made me sweaty. How do stretches make me more sweaty than the actual workout itself??</li>
<li><em>Dogging Cobra:</em> This move made me even more sweatier. I got pretty tired by the end and really had to push through it.</li>
<li><em>Head Rolls:</em> Is it a little weird how I&rsquo;m paranoid about cracking my neck? Usually it feels good but I&rsquo;m guessing I had no knots to straighten out today.</li>
<li><em>Soul Stretch:</em> This is definitely a move that makes you sigh with relief. I love the stretch in this one!</li>
<li><em>Long Lunge Twist:</em> My balance was tested in this move. I have no balance.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>It was pretty disheartening to read the comments on the Blogilates page about people feeling discourage by today&rsquo;s videos. The &ldquo;Abs on Fire&rdquo; video was definitely hard and a little outside of my difficulty range. I stumbled through that video and didn&rsquo;t really &ldquo;complete&rdquo; it at all. But I know that I suck at the moment and I&rsquo;m not strong enough and I accepted it. Maybe this the only advantage of being self deprecating all the time? So if you&rsquo;re feeling demotivated by the &ldquo;Abs on Fire&rdquo; video, it&rsquo;s okay. As long as you even attempt some of the moves, you are making progress. You&rsquo;re not there YET but if you keep pushing through, you will be there eventually!</p>
