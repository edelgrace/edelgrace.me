<pre>CREATE USER 'user'@'server' IDENTIFIED BY 'PASSWORD';
GRANT PRIVILEGES ON database.table TO 'user'@'server';</pre>

I recently bought a VPS from Ramnode and started tinkering on it. I needed to create a database for my fanlistings. Back when I was on shared hosting, I would use cPanel and phpMyAdmin to do all that. This is admittedly another TIL that I didn't learn today but, rather, relearned today because the information slipped my mind. Maybe I need to rename this little segment to "TIRL."
