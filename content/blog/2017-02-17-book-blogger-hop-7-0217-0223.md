> Can you read and watch TV or listen to the radio at the same time? Submitted by Elizabeth @ [Silver's Reviews]()

Nope! Unless we're talking about dry, academic textbooks. I can read the words but nothing will go into my head. I do like multitasking with audiobooks but only when the task is mindless enough that I can pay attention to the story. For example, one time I was playing _Dragon Age: Origins_ (a video game) while listening to the audiobook _Waiting_ by Ha Jin. In the game I was just slaughtering enemies while exploring a forest. Not much to truly pay attention to. Other than that, I cannot read at the same time!
