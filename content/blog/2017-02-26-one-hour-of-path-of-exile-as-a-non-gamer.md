Now I know that one hour is not enough to fully judge a game, especially for an online game which is supposed to be an extremely huge time sink. However, being someone who is not exactly the ideal demographic for this genre (I prefer turn based games like _Fire Emblem_, walking simulators like _Life is Strange_, open sandboxes like _Minecraft_, and RPGs like _Mass Effect_), one hour is just enough for me to have an idea of whether or not I would like the game.

_[Path of Exile][1]_ is an online free to play RPG. You play as an exile washed up on the beach of an unknown land. There are several classes you can choose from: duelist, marauder, ranger, shadow, templar, and witch. I picked witch because it seemed cool and different and I enjoy magic based classes.

So the game starts on the shore of an island. As you make your way through the area, creatures and the undead ambush you. Obviously they are easy to get rid of but their real strength is in numbers. It's easy to get overwhelmed. I will confess, I died once or twice.

Going through waves of enemies in a world empty of players is a little boring. It seems that the game is online but there is little player interaction, other than common areas like towns. I found it to be somewhat unexpected for an online game.

Most of my amusement from this game was the world chat. The players would jokingly call the game horrible, a rip off of _Diablo 2_ (my SO backs this up, I've never played that series), and ultimately dead. And yet, they still play. Maybe they enjoy the little group they have formed and aren't willing to let go but who knows? I didn't bother to ask.

It wasn't until I got my first quest that I finally got to go out into the real world. There, I also found myself overwhelmed by hordes of enemies and died more times than I'd like to admit. I'm making it sound worse than it was but it takes me some time to get used to combat in a game and even then, I'm not a skilled gamer.

So, _Path of Exile_ was a bit of a let down but I didn't have high hopes for it because it was a bit out of my interests. It is free to play so there is absolutely no harm in giving it a try and deciding for yourself.
