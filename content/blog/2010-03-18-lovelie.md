Last Saturday I got to see _Alice in Wonderland_! I absolutely loved it. Tim Burton makes amazing movies. Edward Scissorhands, Corpse Bride, The Nightmare Before Christmas... Holy cheese he is a genious! And Helena Carter is such a great actress. She did the Red Queen so well! Johnny Depp, pssh. He was a good Hatter though.

After the movie, we went to Zellers! There was some toys on display and Cloud touched one of them and then it started to sing and dance. He was so scared that he slapped it and ran away. Literally ran away. Me and my friends burst out laughing.

So, my current obsession right now is Dissidia: Final Fantasy. Even though it's the long weekend, I have to finish my homework today so I can play Final Fantasy non-stop! So... I shall go do homework now!

Bye bye~!

Ps. Miyavi's daughter is adooorable. :3|||1||
