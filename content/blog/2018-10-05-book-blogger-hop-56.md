Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week's question is&#8230;

> It's getting close to Halloween. If you HAD to read one of these two genres, which would you prefer  urban fantasy, or horror, and why?

I have no idea. I don't read either, honestly. I think the last horror story I read was *Frankenstein*. While it is the epitome of 19th century horror, I didn't really find it... horrifying. I also get super affected by suspense so I don't know if I would do well with horror. For example, I put down the book if things get too intense. Even if it's something simple and non-horror related like someone is caught cheating, I have to put down the book and catch my breath. Thankfully with reading, you can't really have any jump scares. It's just the suspense that will really get me.

As for urban fantasy... I don't really know what that means. I've read a lot of sci-fi that might be urban... But not sure about fantasy. I usually don't like the tropes that occur in urban genres. I find a lot of urban books fall into the same pitfalls. I've probably just not found a really good urban book yet.

So I guess my answer would be horror. I really don't like the urban genre and sub-genres, especially if they are YA. I could tolerate horror because, even if it does have the intention to scare, it doesn't seem that bad in terms of scary levels.
