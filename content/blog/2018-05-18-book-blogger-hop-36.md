Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week's question is&#8230;

> What were your worst movies based off of books?

**WARNING:** Spoilers for *My Sister's Keeper* by Jodi Picoult.

When I go to see a movie based off a book, I don't go in with high expectations. I wasn't a Harry Potter nerd by any stretch of imagination so those movies didn't bother me despite their departures from the source material. I usually avoid book-movies in general or just watch book-movies of books that I haven't read or don't intend to read.

So the only movie that comes to my mind is *My Sister's Keeper*. I loved that book. I became obsessed with Jodi Picoult for years and read almost every single Picoult book I could grab my hands on. I thought Picoult was *so* clever in her plot twist and that made the book for me.

When I heard that *My Sister's Keeper* was getting a movie adaptation, I was ecstatic. I was disappointed that Dakota Fanning didn't want to shave her head for the role (I had a big crush on Dakota Fanning back then) but I was excited nevertheless. But when I came out of the theatres, I was devastated. They completely changed the ending. The sentiment was sort of the same. Kind of like, "why did we even bother for all of this if *that* is what happens?" But it wasn't as hard hitting. Characters acted in different ways that I didn't expect them to. But most of all, the ending.

Yeah, that was a bad movie adapation.
