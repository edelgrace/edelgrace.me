The fine folks at <a hre="http://www.skacelknitting.com">Skacel Knitting</a> are hosting a series they call "[Crochet Along Together][1]" or "CAT" for short. They post videos throughout the month to walk you through the project. A draw is also held after the project is finished.

**March CAT**

This is their very first installment and is geared towards (but not limited to) beginners to crochet. The project for this months is the [Easy As 1-2-3 Cowl][2] which is a three colour cowl. 

**Supplies**

  * 3 skeins of HiKoo &reg; Simplicity yarn each different colours
  * 1 4mm corchet hook (size F in addi&reg; or size G in other brands)
  * 1 locking stitch marker
  * 1 darning/tapestry needle

**Why I'm joining**

This is perfect timing for me to enter the crochet world. I had been interested in crochet for a couple of months after my SO received a cute crocheted Yoshi as a present and after seeing a couple of people busting out their crochet hooks in lectures. This definitely goes with my "find a hobby" quest that I have for myself. My SO actually suggested I try knitting but I was a little more drawn to the cute crocheted toys that I so often see. In general, I like how crochet results in something a little more concrete and physical. It seems like a good way to keep my hands busy and give some trinkets to family, friends, and people in need.
