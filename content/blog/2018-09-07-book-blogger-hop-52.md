Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week's question is&#8230;

> Have you ever visited the location of a book you have read?

I'm Canadian and I rarely go out of my city. I have been the Philippines before and once spent a week in New York City. Not many books take place in the Philippines. I'm sure I must have read books with New York City as a setting but I can't think of any off the top of my head. If there was a specific location in New York City, I don't think I would have been since I only visited a few landmarks.

I know that I would love to visit Prince Edward Island one day, from *Anne of Green Gables*. Avonlea is a fictional place, however, L.M. Montgomery wrote and took inspiration from the town Cavendish. Understandably, Cavendish has some touristy spots relating to *Anne of Green Gables* and I would definitely take a visit.

There are a couple of places that I would like to go to but they are more for general tourist reasons and not really for a bookish reason. Some of those places are Italy, Japan, Russia, etc.
