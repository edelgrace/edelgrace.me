I meant to post this Friday but that never really happened. Anyway, better late than never!

So far, school is doing pretty good. I know people in each of my classes and the homework isn't too hard yet. However, there's one class that I absolutely dread going to. That class is physics. I don't dread it because the content is hard. I dead it because of the people in it.

Since I didn't have room in my schedule last year, I had to take physics 20. Most of the class are grade elevens. I know a bunch of cool grade elevens. Sadly, 99% of them did not end up in my class. There's one or two of my friends in it. Most of the rest of the class is, well, really bad.

They're always talking. Not that I don't mind them talking but there are 40 kids in a tiny cramped room all talking loudly at the same time. It's hard to hear and I get quite frustrated when I'm surrounded by noise. I'm not the only one too. The teacher gets frustrated as well. To say the least, my physics teacher isn't the most youngest person ever. It gets hard for him to start class because no one can hear him say that.
