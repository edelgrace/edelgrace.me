Hello, I'm Edel! I'm so excited for the opening of my site. When I first got [Olivia's][1] email, I was scared to open it. But when I eventually did, I first saw:

"Congratulations!

You have been accepted!"

And then I screamed... I Twittered, Facebooked, and forum posted about it. No one really was as estatic as I was, but that was to be expected. I'm very excited for what this site can be turned into.

Anyway, right now I am mourning the loss of Farrah Fawcett and Michael Jackson. So many specials on MTV and Much Music for M.J. I was actually looking forward to his tour (I wasn't going but I wanted to watch fancams on You Tube. haha...).

Yesterday I saw My Sister's Keeper! This may reveal some spoilers for those who haven't read the book (I strongly reccommend it. Although it may not be for the weak hearted and the strongly emotional ones). Basically it's about two girls. The older sister, Kate has APL, a rare form of Leukemia. Her younger sister, Anna, is conceived just to give blood for Kate at birth. When Kate needs a kidney, Anna is fed up and files a lawsuit against her parents.

So, here are my rants, which will reveal **sopilers** (skip this paragraph if you have to). Julia wasn't in the movie at all! They got rid of the whole Julia and Campbell sub-plot. Kate and Taylor have sex! I was watching the movie going "WTF?!? They're not supposed to have sex!" Jesse is the one who lets the cat out of the bag and says that Kate wants to die (Anna originally said it in the book, NOT Jesse). And the most sad thing of all, Kate DIES! Kate isn't the one who dies, Anna is! Anna is granted her lawsuit. Then she and Campbell drive from court to the hospital but they are in a car crash. Anna dies, and then the doctors reccommend for her to give her kidney to Kate. Kate lives. What the heck?! Ahhh!

Okay, ranting done.

Well, I hope you enjoy this site (I know I will!). Love you all!
