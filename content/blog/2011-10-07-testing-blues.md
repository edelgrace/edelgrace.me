Because of Power Hour last night, I didn't have much time tostudy for my math and chem quizzes. Math was extremely easy but the chem was hard. Oxidation numbers are scary. I'm not very good at them. Yeah, I got a 75% on that one. Good thing each quiz is only worth one percent of your whole mark. I want to know what I got on my math quiz though. The suspense is killing me. Mr Dutchak never does update the marks until after the unit test. I kinda don't want to know.

Well, today is the start of a long weekend. Thanksgiving weekend that is. I can't wait. Kinda. It'll be over before I know it. And I have homework to do. Yucky.

EDIT: I feel relieved. My friend did worse than me on the chem test. I feel bad thinking that way, but it makes me feel a bit better.
