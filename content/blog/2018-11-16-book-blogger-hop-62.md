Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week's question is&#8230;

> Do you take notes about the book you are reading as you read?

I only really do this for non-fiction books. Sometimes I take pictures of quotes that really stick out to me. One of these days I will actually capture these quotes and compile them into one place.

Maybe I should be writing notes while I read a book. I do go through times where a book really makes me pause and I think about the contents for a good couple minutes. It's hard to do this though because most of the time, I read books when I'm on the train. Whenever I'm on the train, I never get a seat so I'm always standing. I guess I could take notes on my phone instead.

For example, I was listening to an audiobook of Virginia Wool's *Mrs. Dalloway* on the train and there were so many passages that just made me drift into wonderland. I haven't finished reading it yet (at the time of writing this) but I already know that this might be a book that will resonate with me. It would be nice to capture those thoughts in a timely manner.
