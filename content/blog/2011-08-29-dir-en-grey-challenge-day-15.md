**Your first Dir en grey PV.**

_JEALOUS_. I was so hooked on that PV. All the members were just eerily beautiful (especially Toshiya, I loved his costume) and the beginning sounded like one of the Filipino songs my mom sang on karaoke for parties. Crappy quality was crappy though. It's such an old PV. I wish there was an HD version out there.
