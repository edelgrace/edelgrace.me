I went out with some friends today. It's funny because every time we go to this ramen place, our local anime convention has an event. Last time it was their mini winter com and this time they were having a trading pin party up at the university.

But yeah we went to eat ramen. It was yummy. And then we bought candy. That was yummy as well.

But my friends also gave me presents which was really weird wow. Look at all this stationary I can't wait to use them.

My friend got me fabric instead of washi tape because she couldn't find any but it's okay because I'll find a way to use them. I already used the bear stickies. They're so adorable!
