Right now I'm working on a layout that features someone... I know it's Ryo, but a Ryo from what band? I don't know anymore! I forgot! It's not the Ryo from Maximum The Hormone or Ryo from JE. My friend told me a list of Japanese guys she thought was hot, and I went to find desktop backgrounds for her. Ryo was on the list... Uwah! My memory is bad.

I'm supposed to go to a party soon, but it's mostly for his dad to get drunk with his buddies. The kids that do go there are mostly younger than me, so it's kinda boring... But my cutie pie baby cousin is going :3

Speaking of cousins, I miss my cousins back in the Philippines! Especially Kuya Melchor TT_TT (I'll explain later maybe...). I miss the sun~! It's getting colder and colder here. Stupid Albertan weather!

And last but not least, let's have a late welcome to a new affiliate: [simple graphic lyts.][1] run by the lovely Keisha!
