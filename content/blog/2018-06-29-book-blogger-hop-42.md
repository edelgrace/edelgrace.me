Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week's question is&#8230;

> Do you have an Instagram account? If so, do you only follow book folks?

I do have an Instagram account! Shameless plug, [@edelgraceme](https://instagram.com/edelgraceme).

The people I follow are usually my friends. Sometimes I follow some comic artists because I enjoy some humor every now and then. I also follow a lot of cosplayers because I am *so* enamored by their talent and their costumes and honestly they are all so cute.

I don't think I will start to follow book folks. At a certain point, it can get a little too obvious that people are getting sponsored for posts. There are also way too many books out there and I cannot wrap my head around all the new books that are coming out and are being reviewed. For the most part, I know the kind of books I want to read and some random stranger on the Internet will not. Also, I just can't add more books to my to-read list... There's just too many of them... So many books, so little time!
