### Day 25: Lower Body

### Video 1: Far Burning Cardio Warmup

I've done this video so many times that I've almost memorized everything Cassey said, haha! The moves in this video are easy and fun, as always.

### Video 2: Hips Butt &#8216;n Thighs Super Shaper Workout

  * _Hot Potato:_ This is a nice and easy move to start off the video. When I'm rewatching the videos to write these posts, only then do I notice how graceful Cassey looks doing the moves... Goals.
  * _Leg Circles:_ These aren't hard but tiring. My legs get heavier and heavier with each circle. I had to like look at my legs and will them to go wider, haha!
  * _Side Plank Leg Lifts:_ I had to do the beginner's version of this video, unfortunately. That doesn't mean that I didn't feel the burn!
  * _Hip Twists:_ This is probably the first time I did this move without stopping. I'm not sure if I did them 100% correct but I tried my best to power through them and power through them I did!
  * _Pointed Butt Pulses:_ An easy move! My thigh (?) got a little bit tired though.
  * _Knee Curlers:_ This added some difficulty to the pulses in the previous move, which is fine. I liked doing this move even if I felt like I was flailing about.

### Video 3: Perfect Legs Workout

I finished this video a little after midnight but I'm not going to count it as being behind. This video was the harder one out of day 25 but it did feel good.

  * _Half Clam Lifter:_ I don't really know if I'm doing this move right but it definitely hurt. I tried to keep an eye on my leg to see if I had proper form but the rest of my body felt a little bit weird.
  * _Half Clam Pulse:_ This hurt a little bit more but it was easier.
  * _Lateral Leg Extension:_ "You feel it?" I feel it... This definitely hurt to do since my legs were feeling tired.
  * _Floor tap:_ My foot lingered a little bit too long on the floor but I made it up with doing more on each leg. The stretch after this move was amazing.
  * _Frogger:_ I love froggers! It's easy but my legs definitely feel it.
  * _Frogger Abs:_ I really like this modification! It's an easy move to do, just like the frogger, but I love that burning feeling in my abs.
  * _Heel Clicks:_ This move is another easy one. Lowering the legs make it a little bit harder.
  * _Criss Cross:_ Another easy move. In another video, Cassey mentioned focusing on lifting the legs and not relying on momentum of the legs. This really added some much needed difficulty.
  * _Leg Circles:_ The tiny circles were killer! The larger circles made my hips click and while there was no pain, I got a little bit concerned with the feeling and the sound. I tried to push through it though!
