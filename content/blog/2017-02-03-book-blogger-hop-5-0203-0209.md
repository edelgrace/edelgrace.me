> Read or Clean? Read or Bake? Read or Make Dinner? What would be your choice? Submitted by Elizabeth @ [Silver's Reviews][1]

There are quite a lot of questions for today!

  * **Read or Clean?** If I play my cards right, both! Wait, do audiobooks count as "reading"? If so, then yes. If not, read! I find "reading" a great way to multitask when I'm doing chores, especially when I'm folding clothes. I actually want to buy Bluetooth headphones one day so I can vaccum and wash dishes without the hassle of wires.
  * **Read or Bake?** Okay&#8230; I love baking and enjoying the fruits of my labour so for this one, I'm going with baking! I find baking very calming. Sometimes you need a hobby that isn't reading!
  * **Read or Make Dinner?** READ!!! I hate making dinner. The difference between baking and making dinner is that baking is definitely a treat and a special ocassion while making dinner is something that I have to do. I also need to pay attention to my cooking so audiobooks aren't a good way to go in this regard.
