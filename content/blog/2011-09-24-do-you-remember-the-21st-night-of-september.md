I love the song September by Earth Wind and Fire, so I just couldn't help myself. On the 21st I sang the song throughout the whole day. I was tempted to go and play the song on my flute because I learned it, but I forgot where the music for the song went. Oh well. So, do you guys remember what happened on the 21st night of September?

Anyway, I've been contemplating this for a while. I really don't want some of my blog entries read by some of the people I know in real life as some of my friends know about my various sites, including this one. I keep a lot of private entries because of this. I actually post regularly, but they're all private. So I'm thinking of making password protected entries. If you guys want a password to my entries, feel free to comment in this entry.

So what has been happening lately? School. Nothing new actually. I'm trying to do as well as I can so that means that I have less of a social life but I never really had one anyway so that's a-okay!

I love all my classes. Except for my physics class. Most of my physics class includes grade elevens. A whole lot of them are immature. They're all loud and they take advantage of our really frail and old teacher. Our teacher isn't that great either. I don't really understand anything he says and when I ask him a question he just gets mad at me. Ack. I think our class just puts him in a bad mood. It puts me in a bad mood too. I kinda wish my teacher would yell at them or something. However, I don't think that would change anything anyway.

Well, I have to go as it's my dad's birthday today. Please wish him many birthdays to come. :]
