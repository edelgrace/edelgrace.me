> Hyperkinetic and relentlessly inventive, *Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World* is Haruki Murakami's deep dive into the very nature of consciousness.

> Across two parallel narratives, Murakami draws readers into a mind-bending universe in which Lauren Bacall, Bob Dylan, a split-brained data processor, a deranged scientist, his shockingly undemure granddaughter, and various thugs, librarians, and subterranean monsters collide to a dazzling effect. What emerges is a novel that is at once hilariously funny and a deeply serious meditation on the nature and uses of the mind.

I read too much Murakami. There is something similar across many of his protagonists that I just can't pinpoint. It's nothing too general like that they are all men with strange thoughts about sex and women (although a lot of them have that in common). Maybe I'm just projecting but it seems like a large number of his protagonists are rather... Simple. Maybe even boring. They never think too strongly or feel too strongly. It seems like a lot of the things they do is because things are just simply happening to them.

Which is why I breezed through the "Hard-Boiled Wonderland" chapters and absorbed "the End of the World" chapters as much as I could. The protagonist in "Hard-Boiled Wonderland" is pretty much the stereotypical Murakami leading man. However, in "the End of the World" there is a real struggle to cling to the protagonist's mind. Despite being really dull and drab in the real world, the importance of having emotions and memories is a great driving force for the protagonist.

I was also pulled in by the fantasy aspects of "the End of the World." The little village of people in an immortal land is just intriguing. I really wanted to uncover the mysteries of this world. The revelation in the novel was a bit of a disappointment but I enjoyed travelling and discovering the characters in this world.

However, being pulled back into reality is disappointing. While there was a real sense of urgency that I appreciated (really, I just wanted it to be over), I didn't really feel the weight of the risk as much as the risk of never leaving "the End of the World."

I can't really seem to make my mind up about this novel. I think this might be one of the better Murakami books.
