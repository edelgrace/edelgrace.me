### Day 9: Abs

### Video 1: Total Body Workout

I'm not going to list the moves for this video again because my comments are mostly the same from the last time I did this video. I really am progressing with those pull ups. Not once did I have to grab my legs! However I do rely on my momentum more rather than my core, but still. This might be old news but I still hate the hundred move... It totally hurts my neck and I know I'm doing it wrong but I just can't do it right, yet.

### Video 2: ABC Abs

I won't list the moves to this video either because there are only two moves. The first one is a position where you have to draw letters in your air using your arms. It's hard because it's in a Pilates stance. I had to pause a couple of times to regain my composure. The second move is the same thing but with the legs and different positioning. My tailbone really bothers me a lot when it comes to these exercise. So I struggled doing this one as well, but not as much as I did with the first one.

### Thoughts

My overall thoughts for today? I hate ABC Abs, haha! I think they are the hardest moves so far in this calendar. It now feels like I've been doing it forever but it's only day nine! Time flies... Can I just fast forward to the end where I'm string and fit and can eat cheat food!
