Most people's first post of the year is on the first, but no, I'm unique and I'll have mine six days later. I've been busy studying and working on [Room 304][1]. I'm actually being productive. Okay, yesterday and the day before I didn't study at all and now I'm freaking out because I have a test on Monday. What do I do about it? I post on my blog. Oh the life of a procrastinator.

Yesterday I had quite a fun day. Firstly, went to Wal-Mart and bought _Assassin's Creed_ for our shiny new PS3 that we got over Christmas. Actually, I made the choice to buy it and not my brother. I've been wanting to play that game ever since I had the demo on my iPod. Needless to say, when I got home I was glued to the TV screen and the controller for the rest of the day.

After that, we went to the library. I love the library. I could spend all day in there if the family weren't rushing every single time we go. I got four books and a CD.

I nearly flipped out when I looked at the CD. _DIR EN GREY &#8211; DUM SPIRO SPERO_. Okay, if you don't know, I'm a **huge** DIR EN GREY fan. They're a Japanese band so buying their music is really expensive (shipping costs, the horror) so I rarely buy anything of theirs. I've been waiting to listen to this album for the longest time and I refused to download it anywhere. Now I can listen to it without feeling that guilty, because it's from the library. I'm still going to buy it eventually though.

The thing about the library is that it's right next to the mall. Where did we go next? The mall. I don't like shopping for clothes but I need clothes so I had to buy clothes. That part was boring.

Like I said before, we got home and I spent the rest of the day playing _Assassin's Creed_. It's such a good game... I want the other Assassin's Creed games. Expect they're so expensive! Another time I guess.
