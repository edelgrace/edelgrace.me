[The Art of Manliness][1] put out this list of books. I am not a man but we'll see how I do with this list. Turns I've only read 8% of this list. Out of the books I want to read from this list, I've read 24%. Not any better, but hey. I'm really trying to cull the books I want to read though. I will never be able to read everything I want to read.
