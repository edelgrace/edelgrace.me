I forgot where I heard this tip but it’s good to read papers that are in your field in your spare time. I spent like an hour looking for PDFs that I didn’t have to pay to read when I remembered that my university library provides free access to databases and databases of papers. The paper I want to read first isn’t even related to what I study but the topic is interesting and one of the authors is like my favourite instructor. Most of the papers I downloaded are written by my current professors and past TAs.

I also FINALLY finished reading chapter four of my algorithms textbook last night. I was getting a little bit bored reading about greedy algorithms. Chapter five includes a lot induction and recurrence relations, which are topics I haven’t mastered yet from previous courses. Although, I think I’m finally getting the hang of them. I think I might do the post-it textbook note taking method for chapter six.
