This is a good question. I don't have a preference, really. I think it depends on how well an author can execute their beginning. If an author jumps right into the action but cannot grab me, maybe they're better off with a different technique. If their description of their character is bland and boring, I might put down the book.

But if I really had to choose, I think I might have to go with being slowly introduced to the story and characters. I wouldn't say I'm the type to prefer lengthy descriptions or flowery explanations but I do like being able to have some time to figure out what I'm getting into.

Lately, the books I have read have mostly used this style of introduction. I notice that a lot of the older novels tend to go this route, usually focusing on the nature of the main character's personality. It definitely shapes what you expect from the character. Some might think it ruins the element of surprise but I enjoy it when I have even just a little bit of understanding of what goes through a character's head.
