As you may have noticed, I recently took up learning how to crochet. Since March is National Crochet Month, &nbsp;I decided to take part in some of the activities that are being held at Ravelry.

**MCAL (Mystery Crochet Along)**

This is an event that reveals the pattern slowly, clue by clue. The only hint is that it's an anigurumi made out of three colours. This will be my first amigurumi so I'm quite excited but also anxious that it won't turn out well.

**Team Catghan**

There is one CAL aimed at making items for donation. I decided to make cat rugs as they seemed to be the easiest of the bunch.

**Bag CAL**

This CAL is pretty simple, just crochet a bag! Any bag, really. I am not sure what kind of bag I want to make. I did see one pattern that is easy but it's made entirely of single crochets. A little boring but it's doable.
