Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week's question is&#8230;

> Do you have a YouTube channel? If so, do you post book review vlogs?

I technically have a YouTube channel. It's more a hub for past course projects. I don't post any videos on it. I don't think I would ever do book review vlogs. I'm not comfortable in front of a camera. What I like about blog posts is that they can be as long or as short as you want. The same is true for vlogs but viewers usually expect a lot from vlogs. In a way they are more formal even though the content itself could be pretty informal. It's just not a medium I'm interested in exploring.
