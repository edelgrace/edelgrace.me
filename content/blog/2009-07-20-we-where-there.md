**Some Updates:**

  1. I'm working on a shrine for Green Day. The first project! Whoot!
  2. I'm almost done the icons for the MJ tribute! But I still have a lot to do...
  3. Me and my friends are making a movie. I just might post it here.
  4. I'm making a new layout! This Ueda layout is a bit boring, haha.

**Real Life:**

"We Where There" by Yuki Obata is definitely THE love story. I can't explain it well, so just check it for youselves on OneManga.com or You Tube. But I warn you. If you aren't in a good mood, reading/watching this will just make it worse. So much...angst!

Anyway. I'm waiting for the custody hearing for Jackson's kids. It's today, right? Argh! I'm really anxious. Paris and the kids deserve the best.

Well, I'm going to go film now. Bye bye~
