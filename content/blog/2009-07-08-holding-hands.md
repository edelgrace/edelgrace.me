Comments: Somewhat based on my experiences from the Philippines. I based End Of Holding On on this. ^^ I might have more, but I'm not sure I want to post it. Hands are on my mind lately...  
Synopsis: This is only a temporary affair...There's an end to everything. Even when you're holding hands.

I could feel your eyes on me as I stroked your palm; carefully tracing the intricate creases. A pretty design of curves, stars, and criss-crosses that no one else in the entire world had.And I wish they could belong to me.

You curl your hand around my forefinger. It's so warm, sending tingles through my hand and up my arm."Your fingers are small," you whisper. "I think it's because you're so short." Your grin is teasing.

Blushing, I pry your hand open and place mine against yours. I'm shocked at how pale I am against you. Your skin is a delicious shade of light brown, soft and smooth. Fingertips extending beyond my own. Unreachable. Maybe it was a sign.

But then you swiftly brush my cheek with the back of your palm. Heat sears up my neck; my face turning red.

"Soft," You say, with another one of your teasing grins. Slowly you stand up and ruffle my hair. "I gotta go now, okay?"

I nod silently, my eyes looking past your head.

"Good night," Your voice shrinks to a whisper. "See you tomorrow."

"Good night," I reply, wrapping my arms around my self.

I watch you walk away, and fade into the night. The porch light suddenly dims.The stars laugh as the twinkle against the black sky. As if saying "You only get him for a few days, but we can watch him all day. Everyday. Forever."

That's when I realize how lucky I am, just to even know you exist.
