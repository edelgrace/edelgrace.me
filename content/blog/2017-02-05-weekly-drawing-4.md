I chose last week's picture this time. I thought the picture of the duck statues wearing the kitty hats from the Women's March was pretty cute and easy to do as well. It wasn't that easy, unfortunately. I didn't finish the sidewalk. Didn't want to draw all those stones. My SO didn't manage to get very far with it either unfortunately. But it was fun to draw!
