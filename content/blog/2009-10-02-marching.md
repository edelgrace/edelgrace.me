Marching band is amazing!

Instead of Brendon now... There's Diego.

Diego.

His voice is smooth with a cute Spanish-ish accent. He's short, but taller than me. He plays percussion; the pit section leader. He gives amazing hugs and his hands are cold. I just might like him. But he hasn't talked to me since last week. I need advice! Should I engage in the conversation or let him approach me? \*sigh\*

I have some homework so I'm rushing. I don't really know what else to say.

Back to Diego.

Everyone seems to know I like him... But does he like me? On Wednesday practice (6pm to 9pm FTW!) we all went to DQ for supper together. He didn't say anything at all. But for the rest of the night he looked at me. I only watched out of the corner of my eye. I don't know what to do.

Today he kinda smiled at me but that was it. Tomorrow I have practice from 9am to 5pm (yes, on a Saturday. FML). Maybe I'll get a chance then... To tell him that I like him. But he might like this other girl. Rachel. =P

So confusing!! Agh!

Anyway, catcha later!

Bye~ ^^
