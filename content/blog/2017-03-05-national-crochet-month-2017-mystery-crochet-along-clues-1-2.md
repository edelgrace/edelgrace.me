The group []() on Ravelry are holding an MCAL (Mystery Crochet Along) which I am taking part of. The project is an amigurumi. I have never made an amigurumi before and this will be my first! It will be interesting seeing that I have no idea what the finished project will look like. These are the first two clues finished. I still need to start clue 3 and 4, I'm a little behind.

I think it looks like a bird so far but that's just me.
