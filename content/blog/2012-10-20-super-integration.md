This summer is turning out really bittersweet. On one hand, I just reconnected with an old friend, Sam. On the other hand, I just might lose him again.

I met Sam on Mibba, a creative writing website. I was trolling the journal section for comment swaps. Then I found one of Sam's journal entries. Comment swap of course. But what really compelled me was the fact that he put in a math question in his journal entry. I know, I know. Math?? But I was really cocky and I was decent at math but I just couldn't figure it out. I had learned it but couldn't recall how to do it. I commented on it saying that. And of course, comment swap.

A few moment later, I got a message notification. I never got any messages back then (I still don't) so I was really excited. It was Sam, telling me how to do that math question. Somehow it all went downhill from there. We got talking and exchanged MSN usernames. I remember going camping and talking to him on my iPod and phone. For some reason, we stopped talking though. I'm not sure why.

But recently, I've been having Mibba feels. Mibba nostalgia feels. I found Sam's profile and we commented each other for like two months, weeks at a time, telling each other to go online on MSN and talk again. I think it was just two nights ago that we started talking. And in about three days, I've gotten so attached, you wouldn't even believe.

**DAY ONE**
  
I left MSN on after I got a comment from Sam telling me that he was going to leave his computer on for the whole day. Before lunch, he messages me, "EDEEELLLL" or something along those lines.

**TODAY**

Look at my shirt! -Coheed and Cambria shirt of course-
  
I like small people. It's cute.

Your name is pretty. :3
  
Thank you. <;3 You're cute. <sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_8-922" id="back_ajs-fn-id_8-922">8</a></sup> You're cute. You're silly. Edel smile. Edel talk to me.

Thank you. I've never heard a boy cry before. It broke my heart hearing Sam cry. He cried a couple of times. His small thank you's and his stubbornness. I'm so scared for him. I wish he'll be okay. His life is so promising. He has such a capacity to love. And he's so fucking smart. I hate that it might all be wasted on one girl. All because a girl dumped him. I can't. No. It shouldn't be like that. I never wanted so much to reach out and hold someone before. I still do. I want to crawl up next to him, and just cradle him close to me. I want him to sob into my chest. I really want to be there for him. Really there. There in the flesh. I'd talk to him all day and night if I had to. I'm so glad that he gave me his number. But at the same time, I'm worried. He told me to send him a text and he'll call. I told him the same thing. But I'm afraid. I'm afraid to receive a call or a text from his phone telling me something I don't want to hear. "Just in case." "In an emergency." I can't. I can't. Oh God I can't. Please God. Help him. Please help him. Please convince him otherwise. Give him an epiphany. Give him a chance. I'd give my own life for him. I'd do anything. Please let him live. Please.
