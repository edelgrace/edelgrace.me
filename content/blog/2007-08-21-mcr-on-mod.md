**Note:** This post has been edited from its original for spelling, grammar, and less cringe. Why did I use ellipses so much back then?

I'm excited, even though I'm nowhere near Toronto. Just on the other coast... The last time they were on *Much on Demand* (MOD) was on th 11th of May... It was a Friday..... \*sigh\* I'm very excited.. And Kelly Clarkson was on MOD a few moments ago... She's funny...
