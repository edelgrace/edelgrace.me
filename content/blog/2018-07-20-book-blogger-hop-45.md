> What's your proudest blogging milestone or achievement?

I think the fact that I've had a blog for so long is an achievement. I've been blogging since [2007](http://edelgrace.me/archive/#Jan-2007), so I've been blogging for over ten years now. I remember blogging on a platform called [Mibba](http://mibba.com). *Mibba* was a creative writing website where I would read and post fan-fiction. They had a separate section of the site dedicated to blogging. A lot of my blog posts from *Mibba* were super cringy but I still like keeping them around for posterity's sake.

Admittedly, I go in and out of blogging quite a lot. So it hasn't been a consistent eleven years. I think my longest break from blogging was from April 2008 to June 2009, which is over a year. I can't remember exactly why. Going back through my Mibba account, however, I see a lot of posts that I failed to bring over to this website. Now I'm debating whether or not I should import them... I feel really embarrassed reading some of these posts but they were a part of my past. I'd rather not forget them. I will have to add that to my to-do list.
