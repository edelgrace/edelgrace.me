June 6, 2015. First time for everything. Not sure if I regret it.

My first kiss. With a dude. I was at Y's house. Alone. Alone with him. Since, y'know, he lives alone. We were watching _Firefly_ together. I ended up sitting in his lap. Rather quickly too. "I want to straighten my legs." And then he pulled me onto his lap. No complaints here. Suddenly he rested his head on the other side. His breathing was hot on my left ear. His right arm crept up the nape of my neck, and rested there. For some reason, my insides were on fire. I was so sensitive to his touch.

When he put his head back where it normally is, I reached around with my right arm and cupped his head, bringing it closer to me. I kissed him on the cheek. A couple of times. He murmured something about my "little kisses."

I couldn't concentrate on the episode at all. At the end I told him to play the next episode, "In a bit." He said, "Okay?" in such a way that I thought he was annoyed. I tried to redeem myself. "I'm not watching. Not paying attention."

He got the idea though, that I just wanted to cuddle. We were doing just that, in his chair. He flipped me over so that I was basically lying on top of him. He suggested we move to his bed. I said, "No I'm fine here." He finally convinced me. The bed it is. "Bring your glasses," he said.

I went into his room for the first time. He pushed aside the sheets. I lay on top of him, again. I held him close and clung to his back, forcing my leg in between his. So comfortable.

I kissed him again, on the cheek. My first kiss was a small peck on the lips. I freaked out. Pulled away too quickly. That's a first kiss I'll never get to redo.

We went for it again. Slightly more open mouthed, me clinging to his lips.

And then a third time, his tongue slid into my mouth and our tongues pressed against each other, encircling each other. I think I must have groaned or sighed because he pulled away super quick.

He asked me, "Have you kissed a lot of people before?" I said no and bounced back the question to him. No as well for him. After a while he asked, "Have you ever kissed someone?" Another no, from the both of us.

"Then we both don't know what we're doing."

"How do we know if we're doing it right?"

"We don't."

We cuddled a little more. "Would your parents be really angry if they knew what you were doing?" Well, duh.

"You really like X, don't you?" Where X = hugs | kisses | cuddling | etc. Yes. Yes so much.

I don't love him. I don't like him. Why am I doing this?
