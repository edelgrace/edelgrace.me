Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week's question is&#8230;

> What author have you read the most in the past two years?

Not including manga artists, that would by Ursula K. Le Guin.

I just happened to come across Le Guin by chance. I was itching to read some sci-fi but I was daunted by all the thick hardcover volumes at my local library. *A Fisherman of the Inland Sea* stuck out to me. It was a slim normal sized paperback and the summary intrigued me. When I finally read it, I was in awe. I loved how masterfully Le Guin could make these worlds and alien species so foreign but also instill a human element that was relatable and recognizable.

Since then, I've been picking up her books whenever I see them available at the library. Riht now, I'm currently reading her *Earthsea* series so that'll add a few more books to the count.
