Lately I've noticed a trend on my Facebook page. My "newest" friends are people from my past. This actually says a lot because I'm (trying to be) selective about who I friend on Facebook. My policy is that if I feel like I'll never talk to said person ever again after the "friendship" is confirmed, I'm not sending/accepting that request.

### The Internet Friend #1

I've been bugging my friend in England for a chat on MSN for a while. We met on a writing website and we talked a lot for a year but just stopped talking. We finally got in touch over the summer and transitioned to Facebook! I'm glad we started talking again. We've already been through quite a lot over the past couple of months. It seems like real life is getting in the way again, but hopefully neither of us won't drop off the face of the earth!

### The Internet Friend #2

I met this girl on the same website where I met Internet Friend #1. We both shared a love for Japanese band L'Arc~en~Ciel and regularly commented on each others stories. We graduated from the site and went onto Tumblr. Then she suggested Facebook (Tumblr's messaging system is a pain in the ass). She does post a lot on Facebook, which I enjoy since it's mostly art and not regular 15 second updates on her life.

### The Internet Friend #3

This one goes a long way back! Some time ago I joined an AFI forum and met this girl. After we stopped going on the forum we regularly e-mailed each other about music and our writing (yeah, e-mailing people... I don't think I even knew what Facebook was back then!). When that kinda faded out, we went to YouTube. Soon after that, we stopped all communication entirely.

Then a week or two ago, I was browsing my YouTube subscriptions and saw a video from her account. She had taken up vlogging! I wrote a comment and she asked me for my Facebook. It all went downhill from there.

### That Girl from Junior High

In my last year of junior high, I was friends with this girl in grade seven. She was seriously so adorable! Her round face, her button nose, her boyish yet still extremely girl short hair, her awkward skinny limbs... Too cute! I kinda felt responsible for her back then and took her under my wing. It was a nice year for us!

We did try to keep in touch after I left for high school but it was sporadic. I was cleaning out my cell phone contacts, saw the number, and decided to text it! Turns out a lot has changed.
