**My week for November 09, 2018 to November 11, 2018**

### Top 10 Artists

{{<figure src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dvozrk6m8/image/upload/v1542471097/top_10_artists_yrakrb.png" title="Top 10 Artists">}}

1. **L'Arc~en~Ciel** (+3)
Coheed and Cambria is finally dethroned! And no better band to dethrone them than good old L'Arc~en~Ciel.

2. **Coheed and Cambria** (-1)
I'm glad that I haven't been trying to intentionally listen to less Coheed and Cambria, this was more organic. I still listen to a lot of Coheed, they're still in second place.

3. **My Chemical Romance** (+4)
There are a lot of good songs that I've been rediscovering from MCR.

4. **Green Day** (-2)
Green Day has been gaming the RNG so hard the past couple weeks. I never really notice how much Green Day I've been listening to.

5. **Björk** (+)
Bless Björk. I've been listening to a lot of some her classic singles lately.

6. **宇多田ヒカル** (+)
Oh Utada Hikaru. *ULTRA BLUE* is such a good album. A lot of my coworkers have been talking about *Kingdom Hearts* and since Utada is well known for her songs appearing in the video games, I had a sudden urge to listen to Utada.

7. **Amy Winehouse** (-2)
Why is shuffle so biased towards Amy? I have no idea why I keep listening to so much of Amy, but I ain't complaining.

8. **The White Stripes** (+2)
I'm convinced Jack White is a bit of a nutcase but he does make good music.

9. **Alexisonfire** (-5)
Alexisonfire, I've been craving a lot of post hardcore lately. My *Discover Weekly* playlist on Spotify has been good about bringing it to me.

10. **DIR EN GREY** (-2)
Oh DIR EN GREY. Sometimes I just don't remember why I liked them so much. They're pretty good at times but I do have to be in a good mindset for their music.

### Top 10 Albums

{{<figure src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dvozrk6m8/image/upload/v1542471097/top_10_albums_vh2bfx.png" title="Top 10 Albums">}}

1. **Amy Winehouse — Back to Black** (+5)
Again, Spotify you're so biased.

2. **L'Arc~en~Ciel — KISS** (+)
There are a lot of good songs on *KISS* I really underappreciated this album when it came out.

3. **My Chemical Romance — The Black Parade** (-1)
Ahhhh such a classic emo album. Truly the greatest of all.

4. **Coheed and Cambria — The Afterman: Ascension** (+2)

5. **Thrice — Vheissu** (+)

6. **The GazettE — STACKED RUBBISH** (+)
Classic case of RNG. I never knew I had a lot of The GazettE in my library. I have no idea why *STACKED RUBBISH* was played so much outside of the RNG. I actually don't like much of The GazettE's music from that album.

7. **Evanescence — The Open Door** (+)
Interesting. I definitely noticed a lot of Evanescence in my shuffle. I don't know if I should complain. It is a good album, I remember owning it when I was younger.

8. **Alexisonfire — Crisis** (-3)


9. **Björk — Post** (+)
Definitely up there for one of my favourite Björk albums.

10. **宇多田ヒカル — SINGLE COLLECTION VOL. 1** (+)
I'm notorious for just liking singles and my god, over a 20-ish year career, Utada has a lot of great banging singles. Some of them are pretty dated but I still dig them.

### Top 10 Songs

{{<figure src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dvozrk6m8/image/upload/v1542471098/top_10_songs_n8aidm.png" title="Top 10 songs">}}

1. **boy pablo — everytime** (+)
*But he replies with "ok" every time, every time.* Bless boy pablo and their viral hits.

2. **宇多田ヒカル — time will tell** (+)
This is a goodie. This is a song from Utada's debut album and it is classic.

3. **L'Arc~en~Ciel — Yuki no Ashiato** (+)
Not my favourite from the *KISS* album but it is a good one.

4. **EMI MARIA — Lost in Tokyo** (+)
I think EMI MARIA is trying to break the Western market with her latest singles. While I don't think she made a lot of success, I adore her songs. I really dig this one in particular because it's catchy and relatable.

5. **Björk — Pagan Poetry** (+)
This music video is a little weird but I love it and this song. There is just so much in this song. The music box-like melody at the beginning, the pounding beat in the background, and Björk's voice. The lyrics is dripping with sexual imagery (so is the music video) and it feels so extremely authentic. This is what I look for in music. Artists being able to reveal parts of themselves in a beautiful way.

6. **My Chemical Romance — SING** (+))


7. **Amy Winehouse — Tears Dry on their Own** (+)


8. **Thrice — Atlantic** (+)


9. **Soundgarden — Black Hole Sun** (+)


10. **My Chemical Romance — Disenchanted** (+)
There's something nostalgic and melancholic about this song. It's a song about looking back on life and finding out that it wasn't *all* great but they made some good memories. I like it a lot. Definitely an underrated song.
