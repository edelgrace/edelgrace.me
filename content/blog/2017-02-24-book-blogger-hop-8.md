> How do you feel about books with multiple narrators? Submitted by Eli @ [The Book Supplier][1]

I definitely don't mind them nor do I have a preference towards them. My opinion isn't fresh as I haven't read a book with multiple narrators in a long time. The only ones that stand out in my mind are _Flipped_ by Wendelin Van Draanen and Jodi Picoult's _Songs of the Humpback Whale_. The former was done pretty well and I enjoyed the he-said she-said style. The latter, however, got a tad too confusing with it's multiple narrators although it did get me incredibly invested in the story.

In summary, I don't have any complaints as long as it does not detract from the overall reading experience. As long as I can remember who's who, I can probably get through it.
