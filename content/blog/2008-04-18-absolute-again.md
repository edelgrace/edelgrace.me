My skool is posted on a band's website! That's never happened before. In the [picture][1], the first school listed is my school. It was career day today and the day ended with the Absolute Presentation. I remember the presentation form [last year][2]. Last year was better but mainly because the band was better (Colin Lingren is amazing). But apparently the band that came to our school was better in terms of success. They went on tour with Fall Out Boy and was/is on Warped Tour. Wow! I met someone semi-famous today. XD

I also went to see 27 dresses today. It was a good movie, I guess.
