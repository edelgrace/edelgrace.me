**Favourite interview.**

I don't read interviews except for the ones that happen to appear on my Tumblr dashboard. I've seen a couple interviews on YouTube but most of them were outdated or boring.

The one I remember the most though is Toshiya talking about what Diru means to him. I can't recall the details but it was clearly evident that he loves the band dearly. Something along the lines of "Dir en grey is my everything."
