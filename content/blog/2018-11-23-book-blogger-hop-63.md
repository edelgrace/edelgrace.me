<a rel="_nofollow" href="http://www.coffeeaddictedwriter.com/p/blog-page.html"><br /> </a><a rel="_nofollow" href="http://www.coffeeaddictedwriter.com/p/blog-page.html">Book Blogger Hop</a> is a weekly meme run by Coffee Addicted Writer. Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week's question is&#8230;

> You meet an interesting person of the opposite sex at a club. Suddenly, they start acting as if they're a character in a novel you've read, and they are firmly convinced that they ARE that character. First, which character is it, and second, how do you react?

I'm so bad with hypotheticals. I'm... Not sure? First thing out of the way, I truly do not like most male characters. There are many male characters that just make me groan and roll my eyes. I guess the same could be said for female characters but I feel like I side with female characters more. I also have never been to a club before, I only have preconceptions of what a club is really like.

Let's take a male character from a book I'm reading right now (at the time of writing this), Septimus from *Mrs. Dalloway*. He is a veteran with PTSD. Truth be told, I haven't that far into the book yet but I imagine him as a panicky, easy to anger, yet withdrawn man. He doesn't talk much and spends most of his time at the club in quiet contemplation. A club is definitely not the best place for a man like this.

I guess I would just leave him be. Or join him. I don't think I'm the type of person to thrive in a club either. I'd just nurse a drink and contemplate why I'm in a club.
