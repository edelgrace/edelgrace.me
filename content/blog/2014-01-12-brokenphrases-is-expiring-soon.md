Yeah, you heard that right. It's expiring in a couple of months. I've had this domain for almost four years now. That's so weird to think about! You can "see" Brokenphrases in it's first reincarnation by going into the [Wayback Archive][1]. Reading those posts make me cringe. And I remember when I actually tried making money off of my posts. LOL. I earned like seven cents writing that one post.

# [New Blog: Scattered.me][2]

I originally planned for [Vriska.ORG][3] to replace Brokenphrases as my blog but then I bought [Scattered.me][2]. I'm too much of a domain junkie!

So Scattered.me will be my new blog domain once Brokenphrases expires. I've already been posting since November so there's some stuff to read there already.
