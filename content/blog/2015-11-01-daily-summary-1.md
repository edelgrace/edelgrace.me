This morning, at 6:30 AM, I felt a warm, wet feeling in between my legs. I had just woke up from a dream where I was literally sitting on the toilet. Fuck. I had to groggily get up, go to the washroom, change, and go back to bed. I turned off all my alarms because since it was Sunday, I knew dad would wake me up for church.

I am starting to resent going to church.

We were late this morning. Before mass, a teacher from St. Williams school talked. She brought students with her to say a few words. It was so cute and sweet. The older brother kept trying to hand off the microphone to his younger sister. So adorable!

At the end of mass, some French guy representing Jerusalem came. He preached about the lack of Catholics in the Holy Land. Major eye roll. He just wanted to make money off his "authentic" Jerusalem crucifixes.

After mass, Kelly called for a meeting for the readers. Apparently we have to carry in a different book at the beginning of the mass. April was a little cynical about how all the old people were a little slow to digest everything. I laughed but I don't blame them. It must be harder to understand things when you're older, right?

We had grilled cheese for lunch. Yummm! And we watched Ray play 20 minutes of the fifth episode of Life is Strange. Didn't get past the whole Dark Room Jefferson part yet. Mom cut us short because she wanted to watch ASAP.

I basically procrastinated a lot today. I feel so screwed for my 413 midterm it's almost like it doesn't matter how hard I study for it. My mind is not wired for this course. It makes me scared for my future. And on top of all of that, Linquan is my TA for this course. I wish he wasn't... Fuck. The stress is doubled with him as my TA. I feel a strange urge to be perfect but I know I can't be. I almost borderline hate Linquan right now, haha. But he's such a nice guy. I couldn't think that genuinely. I'm just frustrated at my lack of knowledge.

I ate way too many chocolates today. I also ate a fucking cupcake. Ugh. UghhhHHHHh. It doesn't help that Depo Perova makes me crave food. I want to eat ALL of the chocolate that is humanely possible. I can feel myself eating SO MUcH FOOD and I hate myself right now ugh. :((

Today was definitely a Rooster Teeth podcast today. Watched the Robert Rodriguez podcast (heck yes, Spy Kids!!!). Jon Risinger is so dream worthy. Oh goodness. I like him better with short hair though. He is so adorable. But Mr. Rodriguez looks so much older now and it's so weird!!! What!!! You can't age!!! It's against the rules! Way too many exclamation points in this paragraph...

I am totally not digging how the page moves according to how much I type. It's distracting and weird. Not a fan.

There was this post on my dashboard about love and marriage and it confuses me so much. I don't even want to get married but I immediately felt discouraged by it. Why do we have such harmful definitions of love? I don't think I could ever choose to love someone and stick to that decision. One of the reasons why I don't want to get married, honestly. I am basically a commitment-phone, I guess.

This week is going to be super hectic. I just want to make it to the middle of the week. I can't wait to see Yue. I miss him so much. THREE WEEKS without seeing him. I was so nervous and ugh!!! The BC doesn't make it any better. He's so busy and I'm so busy. I thought he was brushing me off. One of my greatest fears. But now it feels like he's just waiting for me to make the first move all the time... I don't know. I know this relationship won't last. It never meant to be like that. But. I don't know... My missing him has hit me so hard. I've been thinking about him nearly everyday. My heart pounds loudly. I want to get along with him like I do with Tyler. But I don't. I wish I could. Why can't we talk endlessly? Why is our chemistry like this? It's like Dylan all over again. I'm trying to scramble with topic ideas to bring up with him.

Some ideas:
  
&#8211; League Finals
  
&#8211; Halloween
  
&#8211; How school is going
  
&#8211; Teach me something from one of his classes
  
&#8211; My volunteering
  
&#8211; Internships
  
&#8211; How PASA is going

Sudden thought in my head: Why am I so easily jealous? My insecurity is too much for me. God damn. God fucking damn it.
