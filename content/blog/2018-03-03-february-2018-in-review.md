### Summary

February felt so short! Shorter than usual. I suppose it always feels this short because February is short already. Also, Reading Week is a week where we have the entire week off so it's inherently less productive due to the less hours.

I started using [Todoist](https://todoist.com) as my organizational system but we'll see whether or not it sticks. So far I like it. But I've been using the premium version and I might have to pay for it soon... Not looking forward to that. My Amazon Prime and YNAB subscriptions also need to be renewed this month. March will be expense heavy.

### Expenses

My total monthly expenses for this month. I'm not sure whether to include "savings" as an expense since it's just that: savings. So in reality, it's $481.45 of spending but that's still quite a lot, unfortunately.

We went to the zoo and watched Black Panther so that took up most of the expenses. The zoo is expensive, nearly $60 for two people. As always, I eat out too much. I keep telling myself I need to cut down on it but I lack the discipline. I gained a couple of pounds, unfortunately.

I accidentally bought a day pass instead of a 1.5 hour ticket. Whoops. Also, I signed up for graduation and the convocation ceremony fee is hefty.

I bought some tights and they were really cute. They had cat faces on them! I also went grocery shopping for some stuff for my boyfriend. And I accidentally forgot to cancel my Kindle Unlimited trial and was charged for a month.

I need to cancel my gym membership. I've been going to my university gym instead. My boyfriend and I watch more than enough Netflix to justify the price.

### Hours of Sleep

Wow! I was really on the nose for my average amount of sleep this month. I averaged around 7 and a half hours of sleep per night. That's pretty good. You can see my four hours of sleep from the hackathon and the immediate recovery I had the next day. Overall, I'm pretty happy.

### Hours spent on phone

I'm not happy with my almost 10 hours of phone usage but that was during the hackathon where I was dead tired to do anything else. I forgive myself for that. But I'm determined not to spend too much time on my phone this time around.

### Books Read

* The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K. Le Guin
* The Sky is Yours by Chandler Kang Smith [(post)](http://edelgrace.me/blog/book-review-the-sky-is-yours-by-chandler-klang-smith/)

### Goals for this month

* Keep up my 7 and a half hour sleeping average
* At least $50 less in spending on food
* Keep up my Todoist streak of completing 5 tasks per day
* Absolutely no Reddit or Tumblr this month
