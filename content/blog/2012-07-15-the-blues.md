I have the blues. It's this thing that comes along every couple of weeks. The sudden realization that wow, I really have no friends. I can't tell anyone anything anymore. Mostly because I don't like sounding like a whiny baby and because no one really cares. Ugh, I sound like and emo person.

And when I think about my lack of social skills, I just want to crawl into a hole and die. How will I get a job? How will I find my future husband? How will I ever start a family? There goes three of my goals in life. I want nothing more than to be loved, start a family, and have a decent paying job. I don't know. I feel hopeless.

Especially with university now. I'm lost. I don't know what I want to do. I know that I'm definitely not going into engineering anymore. I'm sure my physics diploma didn't do very well. Or my English. And people say, "Some people aren't meant to go to university." Fuck them, I'm supposed to go to university. Because school is the only thing I know. I can't function without school.

Just... Blah. I've never been so... Unmotivated in my life. When I think about all the things I am doing, it's just all stupid. I just want to get lost in a different world and never come back. I don't like reality.
