Finally, my final exams are over! I only wrote math and chemistry but I studied my butt off for both of them. Yesterday I had chemistry. It was mad hard but I have to admit that I studied math more than I did for chemistry. I did go to a diploma prep for chemistry which somewhat helped. Math was super easy but I'm still worried over it. Super easy could mean that it was really super easy or that I just thought it was easy when in reality, I did everything wrong. I'm hoping for the best. But I'm still worried! My stomach hurts just thinking about it! Thankfully I don't have to go to school until Tuesday. Even then, it seems like not a long time.

Anyway, after I wrote my chemistry, I went to the library and stayed there for a good hour. I took out eight books. _Moon Boy (Volumes 1-3)_ by Lee Young-You, _Cirque Du Freak (Volume 7)_ by Darren Shan and Takahiro Arai, _Perfect Match_ by Jodi Picoult, _Poster Boy_ by Dede Crane, _The Truth About Delilah Blue_ by Tish Cohen, and _Kafka on the Shore_ by Haruki Murakami. You can read more about why I got those books [here][1].

Later on in the evening, I went to a youth group meeting at my parish. It was my first time there (and the first youth group meeting in a year) but I knew everyone there so I didn't really have to worry about social interactions and such. There was a lot of discussion going on, which was quite enjoyable I think. I'm not much of a talker so I just listened. I left with a lot to think about, actually. The theme of that meeting was basically being aware of what's happening in the world. Of course, being young adults, we got off topic quite a couple of times but each topic was just as meaningful as the first. I'm hoping to go regularly if time permits.

So, a couple days ago I finally transferred my domains from Go Daddy to Namecheap. Why? Because of the constant complaints I always hear about them, the poor customer service, and of course, SOPA. Yes, I do know that Go Daddy no longer supports SOPA and that SOPA is less likely to exist but the fact that they said, "We don't support SOPA anymore" right after Wikipedia and thousands more said they were going to move all of their domains from Go Daddy doesn't make them trustworthy in my eyes. It's quite apparent that they only made that statement because of all of the money and potential customers they lost. Good bye Go Daddy and good riddance!
