Okay, this is a really tough one. I am sure I have watched plenty of book movies but I haven't always read the book counterpart. Honestly, the only thing that comes to my mind is probably the _Harry Potter_ series or maybe the first _Charlotte's Web_ movie. I think I probably need to read more books that were made into movies&#8230;

There are a whole bunch on my list though!The obvious ones like _Jurassic Park_ and _Forrest Gump_ have been on my to read lists for forever.
