I think I might be falling for Brad. Opps. He's so cute though. ASDFGHJKL WHY IS IT ALWAYS THE TA BUDDIES? And he's younger too. But still. He's so cute. Why. He dated Sarah though. And likes some other girl. And pissed Sarah off by rebounding quickly after they broke up. Why? What is wrong with my taste in boys?

In spare John Malahay (Filipino pit guy) came to visit. Because his classes for university don't start until two in the afternoon. So he chooses to go to his high school to hang out. Sadly, I kinda missed John, including his Filipino gay accent. I remember when I first saw John, he was wearing his purple sweater and blue cap. He was in the band room and on a skate boar. And talking to Alyssa. I thought he was cute. Then I got to know him. Awkward.

In TA we had TA snacks. It was yummy. I had conversation with Brad. Of course, I do that everyday.

Me: Tanis and Anthony are coming tomorrow!
  
Brad: Greeeat.
  
Me: Was that sarcasm?
  
Brad: Yeah
  
Me: Why aren't you happy about it?
  
Brad: I'm going to get yelled at.
  
Me: Why would you get yelled at?
  
Brad: Because of Sarah. But I didn't do anything wrong!
  
Me: ... No comment.

Then Brad proceeded to play with my calculator and quizzed me on cubed roots. Like the cubed root of 125 and 81. I only got the cubed root of 1000 right (10) but that's too easy.

In math it was okay. We did some stuff about circles. I like circles. They're relatively easy.

Physics was decent. We actually did stuff! It was a beautiful moment.

Chemistry was fun. We did a calorimeter lab. Mixed Mg with water. Then MgO with HCl. It was cool. It smoked.

That's the extent of my day. D:
