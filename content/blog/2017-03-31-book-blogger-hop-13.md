Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week's question is&#8230;

> Do you visit every listed blog in the linky list when you are participating in a meme? Submitted by Elizabeth @ [Silver's Reviews][1]

I try to! But I don't always manage to do so. I usually do my blog hopping on the train to/from work. I should probably put more effort into trying to visit everyone. I also don't really check the linky past Friday, even though it's a week long event.
