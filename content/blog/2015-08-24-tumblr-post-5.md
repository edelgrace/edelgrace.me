I’m taking a “zero day” from studying but that doesn’t mean you have to stop learning! I decided to work on my blog and switch frameworks from Bootstrap to Foundation, mostly because Boostrap has the potential to get really bloated and I find that Foundation is more intuitive and their documentation is great. However, Bootstrap has a larger community behind it.

Anyway, I haven’t worked on my blog for a while but it feels good to be coding with good old HTML and PHP again. I’ve always struggled with learning frameworks because I already have a style that I code with but once I get it, it’s easy to adapt. Also, I’m surprised that I have done 0 CSS coding… This will change.
