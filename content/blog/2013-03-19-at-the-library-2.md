Okay, I've decided that [Room 304][1] is now officially a book log/archive with minimal blog posts. This calls for a redesign that will emphasize the fact. Why the change? It was always my intention to have Room 304 solely as a book log. But as I heard about book blogging, I decided I would give it a chance. It overshadowed the logging aspect of the site, and I didn't feel like I wanted to update the site anymore. So yes, a "new" focus for Room 304!

That being said, the blogging part is **not** going away. However, it definitely will not be frequent. I'll just be posting the books I've bought and/or borrowed from the library. Sometimes I'll do stuff like Follow Fridays (minus the following) and other memes like that but those will be even rarer. So yes. My library haul for the month!

I actually took these books out on the 9th. I've neglected to post about it but better late than never! I'm actually returning a few of them today. In fact, I've finished reading all of the books except one. Mind you, 80% of the books are manga and/or are "easy" reads.

So here's the list!

  * **Message from an Unknown Chinese Mother: Stories of Loss and Love by Xinran**  
    While I was doing my daily browsing of all the aisles in the library, I came across this little gem! I wanted to take it out before, but I felt like I had too many books on my plate. So I came back and got it now!
  * **Alcestis by Katharine Beutner**  
    This caught my eye right away because I really love Greek myths. Especially anything to do with the Underworld. Hades you beast. And poor, sweet, dear, precious <del>fefeta</del> Persephone.
  * **Assassin's Creed: Forsaken by Oliver Bowden**  
    As soon as I realized that the library actually had Assassin's Creed books, I had to grab them! I've heard about this book among the fandom and a lot of people love it. Mostly because Haytham is in it? Seeing as how it's a journal of pretty much his entire life, I was intrigued. I also can't bear to miss any piece of canon media.
  * **Assassin's Creed: Renaissance by Oliver Bowden**  
    Saw this one right next to Forsaken. No regrets.
  * **Kimi Ni Todoke (Volumes 1-7) by Karuho Shiina**  
    This series has been on my to-read list for the looongest time. It's almost been over three years, actually! I've put it off because it's licensed in English (I know, I'm horrible). As soon as I saw several volumes starting from the very beginning, I grabbed them all.
  * **Cirque du Freak (Volumes 8-12) by Darren Shan and Takahiro Arai**  
    Okay, I've been reading this series for around two years. These are the final volumes. I just have to finish what I started!
  * **The Limit (Volumes 1 & 2) by Keiko Suenobu**  
    I'm a big fan of Keiko Suenobu. I've read most of her series, _Life_ and a couple of her works. I've always had a soft spot for over dramatic high school kids. On a more serious note, Suenobu loves to focus on bullying and I just love the awareness she's trying to spread. She's always a good read!
