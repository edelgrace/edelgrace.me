My 2018 started pretty quick. By the 2nd of January, [I was back in class](http://edelgrace.me/blog/block-week/). I took a block week course and barely survived. My sleep schedule was terrible and waking up for an 8:00 AM class everyday was extremely jarring.

+ **Jan 31 (cont'd)**: Also went to Kilkenny's for a charity event that my friend was hosting. It was a lot of fun! We ate really huge burgers and played some trivia games. My brother and I were in a team together and we were extremely uncultured. That's okay, it was still fun. One of my other friends, Ray, got super drunk and we were carpooling and it was a really interesting ride. Thankfully our driver was sober!

### Summary

All in all, it was a good month. I spent a lot more than I wish I should have. Tuition is a no brainer but still. I need to get a job.
