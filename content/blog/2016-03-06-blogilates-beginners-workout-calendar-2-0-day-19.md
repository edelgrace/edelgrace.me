### Day 19: Abs

I loathe ab days. They're really hard and not that fun, haha. But I really do feel the burn the most on these days. I need to work on this...

### Video 1: Fun Indoor Cardio Workout

There are A LOT of kicks in this video. I did my workout in the morning today so I had to do some modifications, as always. I would love for Cassey to do a low impact cardio video one day!

### Video 2: Lower Belly Flattener

  * _Hundred:_ I hate the hundred. So much! But today I was able to do it from start to finish, I think. Or at least, mostly from start to finish. I hated every second of it though.
  * _Double Leg Stretch:_ This was kind of a fun move if it didn't hurt my neck so much. My neck always hurts whenever we do these ab exercises... Ugh!
  * _Barbie Feet:_ I felt a little cute doing this move, haha! But don't let the cuteness fool you, it's a bit hard. My legs were definitely getting tired.
  * _Reverse Crunch:_ These got my heart pumping! I liked doing these a lot AND I could feel the burn. My butt kind of hurt afterwards though.
  * _1-2-3 Crunch:_ Another hard move... The crunch is what got me. I have enough trouble doing it without the crunch!
  * _Heel Clicks:_ In hindsight, this is a really easy move but doing it back to back with other moves where I have to lift my shoulders makes it harder than usual!
  * _See Saw Abs:_ I. Could. Not. Do. These! Not to save my life. So I just opted for reverse crunches during this move.
  * _Helicopters:_ A really nice and easy move! It's fun watching Cassey do it. Not as fun actually doing it but there's still some fun in it.
  * _Corkscrew:_ I had a lot of trouble doing these with straight legs but I managed to kind of do them with bent legs. My butt hurt.
  * _Single Leg Drop:_ A nice easy way to end the video. And it seemed like it lasted for only a couple of seconds!

### Video 3: 4 Minutes to Flat Abs and Toned Thighs

This video is essentially two moves so I won't bother listing them. The moves were hard! I kept hearing clicking and cracking noises and it kind of worried me a bit. Still, this was really hard! I had to pause the video a couple of time to catch a breather.
