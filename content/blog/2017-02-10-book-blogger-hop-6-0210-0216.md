> What is your favorite Valentine's Day read? Submitted by Kristin @ [Lukten av Trykksverte][1]

Is it okay for me to say that I don't have any&#8230;? I don't really read anything specifically for Valentine's Day. I also don't recall any Valentine's Day themed books. Don't get me wrong, I _love_ a good romance novel, but I'm not sure I can think of one appropriate for a special day like Valentine's Day. I think my tastes a bit too tragic for that, haha!
