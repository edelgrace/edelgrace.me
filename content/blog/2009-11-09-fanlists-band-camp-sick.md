I'm thinking of changing all my fanlist links and moving them from Ueda Hime to over here. Would that be a good idea? I'm debating if I have enough time to do it in one session... probably not. I might do it eventually though...

I'm sick. -.- AND I MISSED BAND CAMP! Ahhh! Oh well. My friends sent me pics from their phones and one even took the time to text me any moment he could (that was Tanner <3). So yeah, my friends are amazing and I love them! I missed two days of school so yeah, HOMEWORK! Whoot! Not.

Oh oh and there is a layout in the works! I'm trying to re-learn DIV layers cause apparently I learned them the wrong way (haha...).

Some Tanner texts:

"Awe I'm gunna miss you so much"
  
"I am going to miss you sooooooo much"
  
"I wont get a hug from you for days :( tear"
  
"TA was dull without you"
  
"U r missing out"
  
"No you sleep! I will talk to you later"

:3 He makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside. Haha.

Well I have to write a speech. Bye~! <3
