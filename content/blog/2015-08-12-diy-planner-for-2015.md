2015.08.12 &#8211; Working on my DIY planner while watching my brother playing GTAV in the living room. This time, I’m not using my Filofax because I can’t dedicate that much time to cutting up that much paper. As always, my pages are heavily inspired by DIYfish’s [Life Mapping System inserts][1]. I just love being able to see my monthly view and (half of) my weekly view at the same time.
