Tomorrow I start university. Thank goodness for Labour day. I've never really understood what Labour day is. All I know is that it delays school by one more day and that's all I need to know to be thankful for it. To be honest, I'm not at all that excited to be honest. Technically, classes don't start until next week so that's delayed even further.

This week is all orientation. Basically, just having fun and getting to know the campus and mingling with other potential classmates. It's all really well organized, from what I've seen so far. You have to register and everything and you get put into groups based on what you're taking. Thankfully, I know one other person in my group. However, that's also a bad thing in a way. I'm more likely to cling and not socialize at all if I know someone else. We'll have to see about that.

So this week's events include tours, games, sport events, going to IKEA (yeah, IKEA, I'm not kidding), and more. There's a lot to do this week, I'm somewhat overwhelmed but somewhat excited. Excited because it sounds extremely fun and overwhelmed because ugh, people.

This summer I've been staying at home like a boring person. I haven't interacted with my friends since Stampede week and that was the first week of July. It's the first week of September. I'm so accustomed to being cooped up into my room. I might get shocked by being surrounded by a scarily large amount of people (3243 people and counting to be exact). I'm nervous. I get such weird anxiety around people. Last Saturday I was freaking out over picking up my textbooks. It went smoothly but I was shaking a little bit. Hopefully that won't happen at all this week.

So yes, my last day of freedom. I'm going to spend it on Tumblr and talking to people on Facebook. Well, at least that's the plan. What do I even do on my last day of freedom? All I know is that I'm going to bed super duper early because transit sucks...
