<a rel="_nofollow" href="http://www.coffeeaddictedwriter.com/p/blog-page.html"><br /> </a><a rel="_nofollow" href="http://www.coffeeaddictedwriter.com/p/blog-page.html">Book Blogger Hop</a> is a weekly meme run by Coffee Addicted Writer. Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week's question is&#8230;

> Do you follow other book blogs and if so, who are your top 3 bloggers?

Not really. I follow a blog that does book reviews ocassionally but I wouldn't say they are a book blog.

Jane at [Janepedia](http://janepedia.com/) is that blog. I really like how Jane is pretty frank in her posts. It's just a general personal blog talking about a wide range of topics, but all of them are just so unbelievably Jane. Admittedly, I don't comment as much as I probably should but I read each and every one of her posts whenever a new one comes out.

When it comes to book reviews, I usually just look for reviews of books I'm meaning to read or have already read. I don't really read reviews in order to find something new to read. A lot of book blogs feel disingenous too since a lot of books that book bloggers review are ones that they are required to write a review for. In general, I only read and review books that I'm genuinely interested in. I know there are probably book bloggers who don't fit that view I have but it definitely seems like the majority of them are like that.
