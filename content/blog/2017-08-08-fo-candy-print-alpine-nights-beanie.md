> **FO** stands for "finished object." It is a term used by knitters and crocheters.

I recently finished a hat that my cousin asked me to make for her daughter. At first I wanted to knit a hat but I decided to crochet it instead. I looked through many different patterns and had trouble finding one that I liked the most. I settled on [Alpine Nights][1] because the pattern seemed not only simple but also very pretty. It also came with a child sizing which was perfect.

The yarn I used was Red Heart Super Saver in Candy Print. My cousin's daughter specifically requested pink and I figured this would be quite a cute colour combination and not too boring if it was just one solid colour.

It took a couple of hours for me to finish it. The pattern is very straight forward. I made a mistake in not turning (switching direction) every row so I had to restart a couple of times. I did make it a couple of rows shorter than the pattern specified because it was getting a little bit too big.

Overall, I'm pretty happy with it. Even though I made it shorter, I'm afraid it's still big for my cousin's daughter. Since it seems like she grows each time I see her, I hope it would be okay for her to grow into it. We'll see if she likes it as much as I do!
