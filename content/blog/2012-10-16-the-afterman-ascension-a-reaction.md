**WARNING**: Reaction blog posts are probably not blog posts at all but rather, a mass wall of incoherent garble of text. This probably belongs on something like Tumblr but it was too long and you know Tumblr kids. There are _Assassin's Creed_ spoilers (yeah, you read that right, and FOR ALL OF THE GAMES too) and obviously, _The Afterman: Ascension_ spoilers ahead. Tread carefully. I've probably scared everyone away anyhow, haha.

Lately I've been reading a lot of [Homestuck][1]. It's basically a online web comic that follows the crazy video game adventures of these kids. I can't exactly describe it without spoiling major aspects but oh my goodness gravy, it is probably one of the most entertaining and time consuming things in the world.

The reason why I bring this up is because I've been trying to get my friend to read Homestuck, but he has been hesitant to do so. So we struck a deal. I buy the latest **Coheed and Cambria** album, and then he'll read Homestuck. I finally bought it today. My bus stop is literally beside a Wal-Mart so it wasn't a major inconvenience. I've been wanting to have it for a while anyway because I've recently made a pact to <del>cut down</del> stop downloading music because all of the bands I listen to deserve all of my money.

So yes, I bought _The Afterman: Ascension_ today. I just unwrapped the plastic and now it's sitting before me on the desk. It's a wonderful case. It's not like your typical CD jewel case, it's a cardboard tri-fold thing. The cover features amazing artwork of The Afterman being "split by the entities" as lead singer, Claudio has described it in his many video logs about the album. I actually have no idea what these "entities" are. Coheed and Cambria have a tendency to create a story line with their music and I unfortunately don't really follow it. It's an amazing concept just one that I don't indulge in. Anyway, more about the case.

It's a tri-fold kind of thing. Once you open it halfway, the CD is there and the Afterman logo. I'm not exactly sure what to call it but it looks absolutely stunning. Open it up again, and there's even more beautiful artwork. It's very abstract and eerie, I love it so much! Also, there's a flap inside that holds the lyric booklet. Even the lyric booklet is beautiful. The lyrics are paired up with their respective artwork. The page with the lyrics on them is so pleasing to look at. Beautiful serif font bordered with simple grey. The colour scheme is absolutely lovely as well. Orange and blue, my favourite colour combination!

So far, I've listened to three of the tracks on this album. They've all been extremely different from each other so I'm interested in how the album will sound like. I have no clue right now. _Domino_ was released as a single (?) or at least, as a music video. It. Was. Amazing. Probably one of the best Coheed songs out there (you can read more on how I feel about it [here][2]). _Holly Wood_ was leaked and I <del>was forced to listen to it by my friend</del> listened to it and I was also quite impressed. Lastly, _The Afterman_. At first I wasn't too taken by it but as soon as I watched the lyric video posted on Coheed's YouTube channel, I loved it right away.

Now onto listening to the album. I'm actually kinda scared for some reason but I'm also bursting with excitement.

...

Okay so it literally just took me a minute to try to get the disk out, I fail at these kind of things. I was scared of snapping the disk or something like that. How horrible would that be? Okay, don't think about something as blasphemous as that. Now onto the listening for real this time.

**1. The Hollow (2:11)**
  
Woah beautiful piano intro thing. Impresseeeed. Wow. Wowowowow. All these layers of sound go beautifully together. Ah, there's some spoken words. I'm kinda freaked out.

  * I just had goosebumps. There's a conversation between who I'm guessing is the Afterman and this so called, "mother." The voice of the "mother" is extremely haunting. It's really distorted, sounding female but with a layer of a male voice. The last few seconds is just one note struck and some clattering of some sort. Then it's slowly building up to Domino.
Okay reaction time. Wow. That was... Entrancing. Simple of course, seeing as it's just an intro but still entrancing. I still have goosebumps. To be honest, as soon as I heard the voice of the "mother" I thought of Minvera and Juno from the _Assassin's Creed_ series. Some weird god and alien-like entity with the same kind of distortions, wow it's just so creepy and so good at the same time. At the end of the song, you can here the song swell and just build up to Domino and wow I'm so impressed right now, yes.

**2. Key Extraction I: Domino the Destitue (7:51)**
  
I've already stated my feelings for this song ([over here][2]) but I'll repeat myself anyway. Wow. This song. WOOOOOW. I love it. Nearly 8 minutes of yummy Coheed goodness. Even though it's nearly 8 minutes, it definitely does not seem like it at all. Okay time to actually listen to this song with awesome CD quality.

THOSE GUITARS. HNNG. The quality is so top notch, I can't even. A huge grin is on my face right now. The little riff in the beginning is beautiful because of the slight echo it's amazing. OH GOD. CLAUDIO'S VOICE. THE WORST IN EVERYBODY'S EYES. GOOD BAD UGLY OR OTHERWISE. There's so much right with this song. It's hard to focus on one element of the song because beautiful sounds are coming from everywhere. OHHH. YOU THINK THEY'D HAVE IT ALL WHILE YOU WERE LEFT WITH NOTHING. YOU'VE MADE YOUR BED SO SOFT AND COMFORTING. Right now I'm just singing along, haha. This is toooooo good. I IMPLORE BROTHER DON'T WALK AWAY DON'T WALK AWAY FROM ME. &#8216;CAUSE THIS IS OUR WAAAAR. Seriously, the quality of this is top notch ugh almost perfect. YOUR TIME HAS COME IT'S NOW OR NEVER. WE MADE OUR BEDS. TO LIE IN THEM PROUD. THIS WARRING KNIFE THE FLASH OF BLADE. DON'T WALK AWAY. DON'T WALK AWAY FROM ME. &#8216;CAUSE THIS IS OUR WAAAR. ONE BY ONE. WE ARE TOGETHER. WE FALL TOGETHER. ONE BY ONEEEE. BROTHER DON'T BE AFRAID.

Wonderful climax for this song, I can't even. Ugh this song is so perfect why why why why why why.

**3. The Afterman (3:11)**
  
This song was apparently written for Chondra, Claudio's wife. She had lost a friend and was feeling extremely down about it. When I first listened to this song I wasn't too impressed but when I watched the lyric video and saw the lyrics for the first time, I fell in love. I too know the pain of losing a friend and it just struck a chord with me and I was reduced to tears. Whenever I listen to this song, I feel strangely comforted but that feeling of loss is still there. I just love this song to bits. Love, love, love, love it.

The atmosphere of the song is perfect. _She gave her heart. To a falling star. Around the declines. As the tears from her eyes fall. No one understands and no one will. If he's not here then where? If he's not here then where?_ Goosebumps. _Your selfishness has robbed you of the man you could have been. I wouldn't change a thing about you. I love you dearly, my friend._ Tears. Tears everywhere. _My love, I've been searching for my afterman._

This is surprisingly short, a bit disappointed about that but still good nevertheless.

**4. Mothers of Men (4:11)**
  
Woah. That first note. Woah. That bass. Oh damn, that bass. The atmosphere of this song is completely sinister. I love it. The guitar seems to be mirroring Domino in a way. I love that backing vocals. The smooth ring sounds beautiful against Claudio's. Oh god. When the instruments suddenly stop or drop in volume and Claudio is just singing, woah. I haven't written much about this song. I think it'll have to grow on me. But oh. Oh my. It's good. There's tapping? I'm kinda freaked out. And now a weird din. "I don't give a shit." Lol what. What?? The din is growing louder and louder and man just said, "Good night." Goosebumps, I tell you. GOOSEBUMPS.

**5. Goodnight, Fair Lady (3:23)**
  
This one feels very familiar. I can't put my finger on it. This is so good though. Kinda sounds. I don't know how to describe it. It seems very much like a happier tune. I like it. Catchy. I want to dance along to it actually, which is weird. I'm seriously liking this, wow. GOODNIGHT GOODNIGHT FAIR LADY. I'M A SNAKE WAITING FOR YOU, DEAR. I KNOW YOU WELL. The little piano lift thing seemed out of the place though. Even more clattering, what is this?? "Caution: Second Identity Identified" WTF SO CREEPY SO MINERVA/JUNO LIKE OMG.

**6. Key Entity Extraction II: Holly Wood the Cracked (3:26)**
  
Oh man. OH MAN. This one is a good one. Sooo sinister is the first few seconds. It's almost sinful. This one was leaked. Glad to hear it in awesome quality. Claudio is sooo sinister as fuck in this, fuck. HOLLY WOOD HOLLY WOOD. WATCH OUT HERE SHE COMES. I really like the clean part in this song. The chorus is beautiful. Claudio's voice sounds best clean. SHE'S SHORT A FEW CARDS OF A FULL DECK. A JOKER IN THE GAME. POOR HOLLY WOOD. POOR HOLLY WOOD. I love how Claudio belts out "poor Holly Wood." The "Holly" is just wonderful. It kinda sounds like he's saying "Holly Word" though, haha. Woah. Nanananana. That part. Awesome. Awesooome.

Damn. More creepy ass ambiance. Echoing voice. Distortion. Holy fuck. wHAT IS HAPPENING.

**7. Key Entity Extraction III: Vic the Butcher (5:47)**
  
Love this one so far. Much more aggressive than Holly Wood. And raw as well. Claudio's voice is shining with the echoing. A lot more shouting in this one. Holy crap, the backing vocals. "LALALALA" woah. I'm liking this one but it seems to be taking forever. HANG EM UP, HANG EM UP NOW. Woah half way through the song. WHAT. IS. THIS. BEAUTIFUL. SOUND. I like this one but it's gonna take some time for sure.

Now for more ambiance. It's so freaky. I'm kinda freaked out. So freaked out. ASSASSIN'S CREED SOBS. How many entities are there I know it says it but still.

**8. Key Entity Extraction IV: Evagria the Faithful (6:22)**
  
Woah this one is sounding cool. Awesome intro for this song. Do-bopping going on. And Claudio's clean vocals. Woah. The first bang of drums. Oh man. OHHHH MAN. GOOD BYE FOREVER. Woah. Woah. I like this. I have been hit with so much awesomeness that I can't even form correct words. THIS HURT WON'T, WON'T GO AWAY. Wow. That is like a weird chant. I love it. YOU WON'T BE FORGOTTEEEEEEN. Wow that note Claudio hangs on to, I keep replaying it. The chanting. The atmosphere is just so cool and mysterious and jungle-like. I like it. I love it. Someone please. Oh.

**9. Subtraction (3:07)**
  
This one is sounding very electronic. Wow. Lower voice Claudio. Almost doesn't sound like it. This is totally a love song of sorts. Okay, break up song actually, welp. SUBTRACT ME FROM YOUR HEART. Wow. This is wonderful. Acoustic with these weird beeping sounds. ONE STEP AT A TIME. I really like this. Although Claudio's end notes are bothering me. And the off tune (?) twangs of the guitar. So good though.

THIS ALBUM. GETS AN 8/10 JK I'M NOT RATING IT AT ALL. But this album is crazy good. So far my only favourites are the ones that I have already listened to before but that will soon change. Now I'm off to do my many, many, many assignments, haha. </p>
