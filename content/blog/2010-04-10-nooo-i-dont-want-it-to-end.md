So, spring break is almost over. D: Even though it was the most boring 10 days of my life, I don't want it to end. Oh how I will miss sleeping in and just working on my websites the whole day. Ahhh. I also have homework I need to do. Stupid Social. Oh, and I have to memorize Goddess of Fire for Monday. Stupid playing tests.

My mom is sick right now. Some infection in some part of her body. It sounds painful. =/ I hope she gets better soon.

I only got to see Cloud once this spring break, but I think that's okay. He seems pretty miserable just home alone. I wish I could tell my parents about him and they would be happy. Be like one of those moms who gives dating advice to their daughters and stuff. I know they care for me but I just want to know what it's like...

So, I'm still listening to Joanna Newsom. Reminds me of Bjork!
