> **Year of Projects** is a group on Ravelry where members share and update each other on the progress of their knitting, crochet, cross stitch, or other crafty projects.

### 2019

I joined this group mostly because I wanted to kick my butt into gear and actually destash. I have a lot of yarn that is slowly being chipped away at. I also have a lot of works in progress that I should either finish up or frog (discard).

I'm trying my best not to be too ambitious. I have a habit of over promising in the new year. But I hope it's enough to make a good dent in my stash.
