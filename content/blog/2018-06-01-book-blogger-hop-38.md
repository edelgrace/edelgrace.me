Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week's question is&#8230;

> What do you think your blog says about you?

Not a lot, that's for sure. I think because my blog is so all over the place in topics, I think that reflects a bunch of different aspects of me. My blog is not just a book blog. I like to blog about my daily life, my hobbies, and the music I listen to. One thing for sure is that it shows that I can be pretty sporadic sometimes. Whenever I blog, I just blog when I feel like it and that's not all the time. It's like my journal writing (although I have been trying to get better at that).
