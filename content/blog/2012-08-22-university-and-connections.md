These summer months has been filled with e-mails from my university and just me chatting on the Internet. As September is coming closer everyday, I'm getting pretty excited, nervous, and really bummed out. This morning, I received an e-mail listing all of the things I should get done before school starts. Most of them are finished, but there are three major things that I can't actually do just yet.

**My picture ID**
  
I have to submit a picture of myself online for ID card, ONEcard is what my university calls. The only problem is that our only camera (that's not the camera on my iPod) was stolen when my dad went to the Philippines. I'm really regretting that. My graduation pictures were on that camera and I forgot to transfer those pictures onto my computer. Good thing I managed to print some of them off but they're really low quality.

**UPASS**
  
One of the perks of my university is that we pay a small fee for a semster's worth of transit use. Seeing as I don't drive yet, I need this because I'll be taking the train. They say you can get your UPASS stickers now but you need a ONEcard to put the UPASS sticker on. And I don't have one because I don't have a camera. Ah, what a dilemma!

**Textbooks**
  
Textbook lists are finally out and I viewed all my textbooks for this semester, and the total comes around to $450. At first I was like, "That's not that bad!" but then I realized that's only one semester. I want to buy books as soon as possible but I'm not sure if I should go secondhand or if I should even buy all of them. I have to wait a couple of hours anyway because I don't have a credit card.

In addition to this, I went shopping for school supplies a couple of days ago. It doesn't look like a lot on paper, but it actually is a lot, as I'm sure most of you will know. So here's what I got:

  * A crap load of pens, pencils, erasers, and highlighters
  * Sticky notes and sticky page flag thingies
  * A binder
  * An expandable file folder (a suggestion from [Kim][1] in this [article][2])
  * A planner agenda thingy
  * A couple of notebooks

So while all of that is happening, I'm talking to my Internet friends. One of my friends is a math genius. He's going to Oxford for goodness sakes. He was showing me some of the tests he took and I realized that I really don't remember anything I learned last semester. Differentiate? Gradient? Tangent lines? I'm thinking that I need to brush up on my calculus and all around math skills before I go back to university. Like... It looks quite manageable but my mind is drawing a blank right now. I should probably go hit the books...
