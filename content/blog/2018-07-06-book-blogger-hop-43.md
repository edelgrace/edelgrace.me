Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week's question is&#8230;

> If you were stranded on a deserted island, which ONE book could you not live without?

OH MAN. This is such a hard question. Would I bring my favourite book, *Vilette* by Charlotte BrontÃ«? I've only read it once, I'm not sure I could read it more than a couple of times. There are very few books that I have read more than once. Maybe I would bring a super long book or a book that contains several volumes in one. I really don't know.

If I were to be stranded on a deserted island, I think my main focus would be to survive. Would I even have any time to read? I would be too busy trying to find food or build shelter. But maybe if I've lost hope, it would be good to die reading a book.

So. What would be the last book that I would read? In that case, I think I would bring along *Vilette*. It's a bittersweet book that touches me so deeply. I would love to read it on my deathbed.
