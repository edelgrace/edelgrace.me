Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week's question is&#8230;

> How many books have you statted but just couldn't finish? Submitted by Elizabeth @ [Silver's Reviews][1]

How **many**? As in, a specific number? Too many to count. Actually, that's not accurate. I don't really know the answer to that question. There have been a lot of books that I gave up on. The most recent book was _The Rebel_ by Albert Camus, however I am determined to finish it. A couple of Amy Tan books were hard for me to complete. _Cryptonomicon_ is another one that I've started and restarted to read over and over again. Yeah, there's a lot&#8230; No way I could list (or count) them all!
