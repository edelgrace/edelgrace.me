Yes, it is finally December!

The first day of December was okay. In math I got my last unit test back. 91%! But then I got my quiz back. 64%! My marks have such variety, don't they? I felt like my math teacher was giving me disappointed looks all through class because I did so bad on this quiz. This unit we're doing, permutations and combinations, is really weird for me. I get the answers right in my homework but I'm not getting it. I understand what to do but I just don't get it. I'm not used to thinking like this. It's stuff like probablity. I was never good at probablity. I prefer formulas that are concrete and don't require much thinking. Ugh, I hate this unit. I said that to my friend with such force and venom in my voice, I think I scared him or made him think I was a freak. Well, I'll just do super amazing on the unit test and then my math teacher will replace the mark. But I hate looking at that 64%...

To be honest, I don't remember much about today except for the math thing, haha. In spare I just do homework, physics is such a bore, and chemistry isn't something where many exciting things happen. Actually, that last bit was a lie. My chemistry teacher has such a sweet personality. Her jokes are plentiful. Although it's not enough to energize me and keep me awake. I've never fallen asleep in any class but I've been close to, especially last period (which is chemistry for this semester).

There's no drama right now, which is always a plus. Although my friend's ex-boyfriend is getting deported back to his home country (which is the reason why they broke up) which is dramatic but not really. It's quite saddening because they were such a cute couple.

Oh, and I must mention that I opened my very first fanlisting!

If you are a fan of index cards, please don't hesistate to join. ^^ I also applied for a Yukihiro Awaji fanlisting today. I love him so much, he's one of my favourite musicians! Forever my bias.

I think that's all for today. I am once again trying to post as much as I can. I predict many posts with little to no comments as I don't have enough time for blogwalking but I will reply to any comments I receive asap. :D
