Today I procrastinated but it ended up with me doing something productive but it still wasn't something that I shouldn't be doing. Today I finished designing for my future fansite and/or fanlisting (I have yet to be approved) for Yukihiro Awaji, the drummer for the Japanese band L'Arc~en~Ciel. It's quite simple but I'm okay with it. I have yet to code it though.

I also finished designing and coding a new layout for Pure Orenji. It took me two days, phew! There are still some minor tweaks but those will be fixed later. I'm going to add new pages to Pure Orenji but that won't happen until either Christmas or Spring break.

Tomorrow I'm going to turn off the computer and study. I have three tests to do next week, ouch.
