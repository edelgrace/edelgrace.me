My exams ended relatively early last semester. That meant more time for a break! I didn't do terribly a lot over through break though. Definitely was not as productive as I would have liked to be.

**Finished watching and reading Shingeki no Kyojin**
  
Shingeki no Kyojin is an anime. The Internet has been basically exploding over it (my part of the Internet anyway). My friends in real life also freak out over it and so much so that I just had to see what they were on about. I definitely watched the last 13 episodes all in one sitting. It's a really awesome anime. The world and plot is cleverly crafted. Oh, you don't even know how clever the plot is!

I also finished reading the manga, starting from the very beginning. It was _really_ good. The manga is ahead of the anime and if you thought the anime was clever... Just you wait until you catch up with the manga. I guess the good thing is that the anime is really close to the manga.

**Set up my Filofaxes**
  
If you don't know what a [Filofax][1] is, it's a company that makes binders that hold planner pages. They come in several sizes, colours, materials, and designs. They're also a bit expensive... I bought three and am currently using two. One is wallet and one is my day planner. I took a couple of days to personalize both. They're not 100% done but I like them the way they are right now.

**Turned 19**
  
Yeah, I turned 19. Big whoop. I'm getting older. Upside is that I'm the youngest out of my group of friends. I won't feel too old once everyone starts turning 20/21 this year. ;) But yeah I had a nice little get together with high school friends. All of my exclusively university only friends are from out of town and were away for the break which was understandable. It's so good to see my high school friends though. I really have to keep in touch with everyone haha.

**Played a lot**
  
My brother bought Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag and my friend lent me all of the Metal Gear Solid games. I mostly played Assassin's Creed over the break. It was good but not as good as I hoped it would be. Eventually I'd like to post on that as well.

**Did nothing**
  
Those were my biggest accomplishments for the winter break. Not entirely world changing but the goal was to relax, which I did! I wish I worked on my websites even a little bit but I opted for working on my Filofaxes instead. I just might have to dedicate a section in Ainsley<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-429" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-429">1</a></sup> to projects like those. Don't worry, I put it in my planner to-do list.
