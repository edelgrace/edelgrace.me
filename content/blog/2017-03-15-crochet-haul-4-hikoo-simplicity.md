I made a post about participating in <a hef="http://edelgrace.me/blog/crochet/crochet-along-together-1-easy-as-1-2-3-cowl-part-1/">Crochet Along Together (CAT)</a> to make a three colour cowl and the yarn I ordered for the project finally arrived! It was good timing too because the event started the next day. I was getting a little worried that it wouldn't arrive in time.

Despite the discount I got on the yarn due specifically to the CAT (the CAT was sponsored by this brand, I think), it was kind of pricey for me. Mind you, this is definitely due to the fact that the Canadian dollar is doing so shitty right now. Also, I'm speaking from a broke university student perspective, ~$40 is a lot to spend on three small-ish skeins of yarn. The shipping and the conversion is really what hit me the most. But I shouldn't complain because the yarn looks great.

Seriously, they are absolutely gorgeous. Funnily enough, the colours were arranged exactly how I wanted them to be. I feel like these colours fit very well together and I love blue and orange combinations.
