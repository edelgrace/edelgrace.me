I made two jellyfishes for Christmas presents. The pink one was for my friend, Kiran, but then I forgot to bring it to her when we met up. Whoops. It was a bit of a testing jellyfish. I wanted to use up the cotton yarn I had. I figured the pink and white would make a good combination. If you can look closely, the white tentacles have fleks of colour in them. I think it looks pretty nice!

The blue jellyfish is for my other friend, Ray. I really [looked all over the place](/blog/yarn-haul-9-10-gina-browns-and-stash) for safety eyes. At first I tried out buttons but I didn't like the look of it. I'm definitely not skilled at added faces to amigurumi but I think the mouth turned out alright. It looks a little mischevious, it adds some character I think!
