Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week's question is&#8230;

> Do you like to finish one book before starting the next or do you read several at once?

I'm notorious for reading several books at once but eventually it turns into reading one book at a time. I have a ton of books I've started only to drop for another book instead. I wish I was a faster reader or had more time to read more books then I wouldn't feel the need to start so many books at the same time!

For example, there was a time where I would be listening to an audiobook while I was studying and then I would be reading a physical book during bus rides and then I would have an e-book that I would read while on the computer. Too many things going on at once!
