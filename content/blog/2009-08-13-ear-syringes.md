I can hear again! I went into the walk-in clinic and they shot hot water in my ear. It felt like those jet hot tubs...except in your ear. Haha. It kinda hurt but the main thing is, I CAN HEAR!

Anyway my best friend is in the US and I miss her! She's missing out all the fun youth events at church. Like tomorrow is the Corn Maze! Yes, Corn Mazes! I've never been in a maze before but it sounds fun! I hope it doesn't rain so I can go!

I'm working on my MJ tribute! I have so much to do! I'm having fun with it anyway. I'm going to go actually work on it now! See ya!
