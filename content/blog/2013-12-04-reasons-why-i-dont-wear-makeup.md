  * I'm lazy.
  * It's expensive.
  * Out of the three times I've worn makeup in my life, I felt more self conscious with makeup than without.
  * I feel like a clown.
  * It physically feels weird on my face.
  * If y'all don't love me without the makeup but love me with it, I don't think I'd want to wear it in the first place.
