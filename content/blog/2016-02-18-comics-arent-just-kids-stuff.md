I initially started writing this post in 2012. I've been going through and cleaning out my drafts and decided this one was worthy of continuing and actually publishing.

Comics are usually written off as being childish or something only nerds can enjoy. But, I'm not here to argue whether comics are legitimate literature or not. I'm here to point out some of my favourite web comics. I don't know where it started but I got bored one day and eventually ended up on a web comics site. I thought I wasn't one for web comics but eventually, I was hooked.

### MYth

[MYth][1] by [Zelda][2]. I stumbled upon the author's DeviantArt page and eventually ended up on her web comic. I was immediately impressed and in awe.

MYth is a spin off on Greek mythology. It's so good that it received two awards from Tokyopop, one of the major comic book publishers in North America. In MYth, there are multiple story arcs. The arc I last read included Zeus and Hades (typical, right?) in their younger years in a different light than most people would think of. Zelda has such a wonderful interpretation of the two gods and their relationship that it makes the story seem like her own and not taken from myths. It's just an incredible comic.

### One Halfed

On the other side of the spectrum, there's angst-ridden and dramatic slice of life web comic, [One Halfed][3] by 2die. This comic is absolutely beautiful. The drawings are expressive and just so darn appealing to the eye. Also, you can't ignore the plot. It's mostly character driven so if you're looking for some action packed explosions you're looking in the wrong place. The characterization and the development of the characters are superb which is rare for any kind of literature. Currently, updates are slowly trickling in. The artist was on hiatus for a while but it seems that they are "back."

### No Pink Ponies

[<img src="http://scattered.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/nopinkponies.gif" alt="no pink ponies" width="468" height="60" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11051" />][4]

Okay, [No Pink Ponies][4] hasn't been updated in over a year now. It's incredibly sad but the journey through the comic is worth it. It's sad when an author abandons their work but it's pretty much normal in the web comic world. This comic is very slice of life and a little goofy. It's a lot of fun with the right amount of seriousness. Unfortunately (?) it does play into the whole geeky aspect of comics and such, but I love geek culture so that wasn't an issue for me. I adore the art style. It's very much "Western comic" to the tee.

### Crescendo

[<img src="http://scattered.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/crescendo.gif" alt="crescendo" width="468" height="60" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11052" />][5]

I really love my slice of life! This one is very centered on romance. The characters can be a little bit one dimensional, fitting perfectly into their stereotypes but overall, they're pretty interesting! Usually you hear about the "rich girl" and the "working class guy" but it's nice seeing it "switch up." I really enjoy [Crescendo][5]! The art is so pretty and since it's an active comic, I love reading the comments whenever an update comes up.

### Society of Vice

[<img src="http://scattered.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sov.jpg" alt="sov" width="350" height="60" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11053" srcset="http://erzadel.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sov.jpg 350w, http://erzadel.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sov-300x51.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" />][6]

The great thing about self-publishing comics is that there is so much variety in the range of topics that can be covered from all sorts of different people without restraint. [Society of Vice][6] is about a therapy group which includes a couple of LGBTQ+ members. The water colour art style is GORGEOUS! Seriously! Unfortunately, the comic is currently on hiatus last time I checked. The content is pretty mature so read with caution.
