Over the weekend I had eaten two plates piled high with sweet American-Chinese prepared meats, a plate full of sweet desserts, and a take-out box of homemade cookies. On Friday I almost consumed an entire bag of buttery popcorn but the bag spilled into the aisle as it descended up the movie theatre steps. As I heard the small popped kernels tumble out of the bag, I felt both relief and disappointment. I was looking forward to eating the buttery goodness the moment I received the free movie tickets as a gift. Going to the movies was an excellent excuse to gorge on popcorn. But I also felt relieved at the amount of calories that didn't pass through my mouth. The next day, however, I walked into the grocery store and bought a box of microwaveable popcorn. My justification was that I would have eaten the popcorn eventually anyway.

So Sunday night I tried hard not to think about all the energy I consumed and how little I exerted. Well, I walked over 10k steps on Friday from window shopping. But it still wasn't enough.

I made a resolution to myself: new week, new me. I will definitely cut down on my food consumption.

On Monday I grabbed a bag of chips from the vending machine. I had no idea what kind of flavour "Au Gratin" was but it looked good. The cheesy taste was too overpowering. To drown out the taste I got another bag of chips and a chocolate bar.

Tuesday I baked three cheesecakes. I only intend to eat one and giveaway three but I accidently used 1 cup of sugar instead of 1/4 cup.

Today I went out for lunch at Tim Hortons. A toasted plain bagel with cream cheese and a cafe mocha. Not too bad but I also plan on eating that cheesecake later today.

New month, new me, probably.
