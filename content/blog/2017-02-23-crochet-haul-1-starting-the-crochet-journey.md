Right now I'm in a quest to find a hobby that doesn't involve sitting in front of a screen. I recently started learning the guitar and now I've decided to add crocheting onto my plate. I have always been secretly envious of those who can knit and/or crochet. I love it when someone busts out a project their working on while on the bus and train. I also adore the small little crocheted toys that I see around the net. My SO received a crocheted Yoshi which was the cutest thing ever.

I ordered a set of hooks and some yarn online. However, to tide me over until they arrive, I dropped by Wal-Mart to grab some cheap things.

In total, some stitch markers, a 5mm crochet hook, and two small balls of yarn cost me $13.63 including tax. Not bad, I guess. I still don't really know how much these things should cost and what I should expect in terms of quality. But since I'm still beginning, I figured I may as well not spend too much on high end items.
