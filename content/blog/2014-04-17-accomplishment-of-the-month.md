I want to devour him.
  
I want to pull at his hair.
  
I want to run my tongue along his crooked teeth.
  
I want to rake my nails across his back.
  
I want to nip at his ear.
  
I want to hear my name come out of his mouth from desperation.
  
I want to see his brow furrow and his jaw slacken.
  
I want him to devour me.
