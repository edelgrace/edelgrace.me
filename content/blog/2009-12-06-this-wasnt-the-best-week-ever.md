Guess what?

He's dating someone.

Whoot, whoot. I mean... I'm glad he told me. I'm glad I found out from HIM. He said that I was one of the first people he told. So I'm happy he trusts me.

But... I'm still jealous. I mean, she's so nice and she told me she was sorry... I can't help it.

And, he said he knew I was pretending to be happy.
  
I'm not pretending.
  
I'm trying to be.

Because he looks so happy holding her hand, laughing with her... I just have to smile. I'd rather have him be happy.

I've been trying to rid of myself of him since she came into the picture, cause I knew this was the inevitable.

I cried in her arms on Saturday.
  
He wants to talk to me on Monday.

Tara tells me to not turn into a David Carpenter going emo over one person. I won't. I hope. XP

\*sigh\*

About site things! I'm making a new layout. For the site to use. And another for like... resources.

This post has a lot of spaces/line breaks in them. XD

Well, wish me luck.

Night =]
