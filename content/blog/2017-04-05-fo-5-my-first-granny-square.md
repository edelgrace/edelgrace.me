My [previous FO][1] was part of the March National Crochet Month and this one is no different. Except this event is a charity run. This square will be going to a charity to be part of a blanket! Different squares from different people will all be sewn together. I think it's a cool joint effort!

It took me a swatch to get the hang of making a granny square. Thankfully the process is straightforward. It's quite relaxing to do! I would love to get rid of my leftover yarn from the MCAL.
