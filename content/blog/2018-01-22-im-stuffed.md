**Disclaimer:** These are my own opinions of these restaurants, this post is **_not_** sponsored!

This weekend was a very filling one. Each day I was eating something yummy, somewhere!

## Friday

My brother and my cousin went to [Blue Fin Sushi](https://www.bluefinsushiab.com/). They have an all you can eat lunch pretty cheaply for $17.84 CAD. No limits or anything! I was supposed to go with them last week but I ended up missing it. Last week my cousin ate so much he threw up. I took that as a good sign that they wouldn't skimp out on the food.

So my brother and cousin suggested to go again and I could finally go with them! I had been waiting for this lunch the entire week. I definitely did not push myself to the point of throwing up but I did eat enough to feel considerably full. I could have powered through one more order but it is a lot of sushi!

## Saturday

My birthday was last December. I originally planned for a lunch but the weather was extremely bad. It snowed quite a lot and the roads were terrible for driving. So I cancelled it and then rescheduled! Unfortunately not everyone could make it still but still had good attendance.

The person who couldn't make it was the person we were counting on guiding us through the menu since he's been there a couple of times. I decided on going to [Moon Korean BBQ](http://www.moonkoreanbbq.com/) because I've heard nothing but rave reviews about it from my friends. It was the cutest little restaurant. The decor was minimalistic but also homely with some Korean pop music going on in the background.

They even had the cutest cutlery sets!

Anyway, we ended up just getting the all you can eat menu. We had a two hour time limit of 10 different items per round. We ate a lot of meat and opted for grilling our food ourselves (but not without some handholding from our server).

The food was absolutely delicious. I wish I remembered to buy cheesecake for dessert though. 10 out of 10, would eat again!

## Sunday

Sunday was much less glamorous. My cousin had coupons for Taco Time and we just went and bought burritos. I bought a beef and cheese burrito and, man, it is a lot of meat. I could not finish it and felt full for the rest of the day. We also went to buy timbits for a snack afterwards.

There was a Goodwill nearby and we decided to drop in. I've never been there before and wanted to see what was there. There were a bunch of cheap tea sets that made me think of _Moon Korean BBQ_. I know where I will shop for my dishes and such for when I move out!

## In Summary

This weekend was really nice! I spent too much money and calories on food, however. I'm hoping to cut down on all this food from this point forward.
