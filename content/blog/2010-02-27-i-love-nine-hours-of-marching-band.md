This is super long so I divided this into days XD

[Now][1] | [Monday][2] | [Wednesday][3] | [Thursday][4] | [Today][5]

<a name="now"></a>Haha, okay nine hours can be a bit exhausting for me. Blocking, playing, getting yelled at is extra fun and is exactly how I love to spend my Saturdays! But knowing that all my other friends are going through it, makes me feel a bit better!

Ah so, I got approved for the Outsider "Loner" fanlisting. Holy cheese. I'm like, astounded. Now I have four weeks to put it up. But a thing that I didn't get approved for was my application for Domain Rental ^^" Olivia didn't like my layout as much. I didn't either but good thing yesterday I was working on a better layout. Yayay. I'll make sure it's way better than the one I was thinking of.

<a name="monday"></a>So a couple of things happened over the past few days. On Monday I was sick, and then Cloud got sick too. I felt like I made him sick, ah I told him not to get too close to me! But then my friend said that we both might have mono. O_o

To recap, my friend Rio had a friend who had mono. His friend kinda coughed in his face a lot, and accidetally shared food on more than one occassion. So me and Dylan and Rio are chilling at Chinook mall and I eat half of Rio's burrito, Dylan eats the other half and drinks Rio's pop. It was ony after we did that, that Rio told us that he might have mono. Thank you Rio... But there's little chance that me and Dylan have mono. So yeah, being sick is never fun.

<a name="wednesday"></a>Then on Wednesday I had gym. Since I'm in bandie gym (a gym class with mostly band kids in it) I don't take gym seriously cause no one else really does. But there's always that one kid who is always hardcore and intense.

That kid is named Bolton. He's not in band but he's in our gym class. I went to junior high with him and kind of used to like him. He's a hockey player and quite good at what he does.

Anyway, so we were playing floor hockey and Bolton was quite in his element. I was standing there, waiting for someone to steal the ball away from him (fat chance of that) and instead, WHAM, I get a ball shot at my eye.

It was weird cause I was just looking at Bolton direction and all of the sudden he looks at me with a surprised face and then something hit me, and there was a flash of white. Instantly I hold my eye, and get down to the fetal position. I hold my eye or a good two minutes when Marina is the only one who starts rubbing her hand on my back and saying soothing words to me. Yay for Marina!

I get some ice on it and then I get to sit out for the rest of the period! Whoot! But people stared at me weirdly in the hallways while I held the ice on my eye but it was all good. Cloud kinda freaked out though. Calling Bolton a dumbass and threatening to punch him haha. It was quite cute because I can't picture Cloud taking on Bolton haha. I'm not sure who would die first. Bolton or Cloud.

In social Patrick said that I looked more Asian on the half of my face where I got hit since my eye had swollen quite a bit. Thanks Patrick.

Surprisingly, my eye didn't swell shut which I thought it would do. By the end of the day you could barely tell I had been hit. Except below and above my eye, it was a bit red.

Uwah, also on Wednesdy it was my friend's 16th birthday! Tara is in marching band as well, and plays the trombone.

On Wednesdays we have practice in the morning and as well as practice in the evening from 6-9pm. It's kinda pointless to go home and come back to school, so most people just stay and chill in the band room or go out for supper at DQ or Chinook or if you're part of the Diana crowd, you ALWAYS go to Chinatown (I'm part of that crowd haha. It makes sense for me to go to Chinatown since I'm Asian).

But this time me and Cloud didn't go to Chinatown but instead went to Jack Astors, were Tara's birthday dinner party was held. So we get there, and get the biggest table because there was 18 of us. Yes, you read right. 18 marching band kids coming to Jack Astors for a party.

We sat down at this large table, and the first thing Mario [baritone] grabs is a jar of crayons. On the table was construction paper so we would draw on it :DDD The first thing people drew were vulgar things. Of course.

And then we got to order our drinks. I got Vanilla Coke but Cloud, being the only legal one there, got beer. Of course. Everyone was like "Cloud, buy me a drink." or "Give me a sip!" but he was like "I'd rather not go to jail. And I don't condone underaged drinking even though I have before..." I think that's the case with many.

So we ordered our food and it didn't get there until 5:15. We all gobbled our food down, left the table at around quarter to-ish. But it took forever to pay. Since it was all separate bills. Some people had debit, cash, or didn't have enough money. Ugh. After about half of us finished paying, we bolted for the train station.  Thank gosh it was ony across the street. And only after a few minutes of waiting the train came by. Perfect timing! But in the end, we were still late to band XD

<a name="thursday"></a> onThen Thursday we had a new girl in band! Her name is Shannon and she's cute and short and an alto. But sadly not as short as me. She made a good impression on me. Her locker isn't that far away from mine either. Yay!

<a name="today"></a>And finally, today. Today I had band camp. (AKA nine hours of marching, including lunch and breaks).

For the first half hour, we did this thing called conditioning. Mike and Josh (marching instructors that are very hot and in their early twenties) make us do some sort of activity that gets us across the gym floor. Sprinting, lunges, grape vines, etc etc. It's to check that we're fit. We're in a marching band, not a basketball team, but I guess fitness is a good thing.

We blocked a whole lot today. From charts 20 something to 45. Ugh, it was exhausting. Blocking is basicaly learning our show. We march to our dots which is a spot on a field. Our marching makes pretty shapes and such. It's really hard since we have to learn it by muscle memory. I use people for markers even though I probably shouldn't... But I got through it! I only epically failed once or twice (marching in the wrong direction is always geniousness).

Ahh and then in lunch, the microwave in the band room somehow broke. Cloud's popcorn didn't pop well enough haha. Lunch was very interesting. For once I was surrounded by Cloud's friends. Which some are my friends as well. There's this guy named Jeff who's a tuba. He has this amazing low voice and he sounds like the Kool-Aid man.

Okay I'm going to stop there. I'm exhausted from band, it's 12 am, and sleep is always good! I like to procrastinate but not on sleep! XD Good night!
