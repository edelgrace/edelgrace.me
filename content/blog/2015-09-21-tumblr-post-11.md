I came to school three hours early today (I start at 10) so I can get a head start on the exercises we’re doing today in tutorial. It’s just so awkward when the TA asks for the answer and no one speaks up. I mean, I probably wouldn’t answer anyway even if I did them before but you know how it goes. Anyway, I had to take a break because I don’t know what I’m doing.
