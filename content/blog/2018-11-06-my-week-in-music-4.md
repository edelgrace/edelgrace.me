**My week for October 26, 2018 to November 02, 2018**

### Top 10 Artists

{{<figure src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dvozrk6m8/image/upload/v1541376450/top_artists_ds6nsr.png" title="Top 10 Artists">}}

1. **Coheed and Cambria** (-)
    Still reigning as the top artist. I'm terribly bad at not listening to Coheed and Cambria. I haven't even been listening to the new album, really. I'm actually quite afraid of overplaying the new album.

2. **L'Arc~en~Ciel** (+)
    The lead singer of L'Arc~en~Ciel, HYDE, released a single recently. It made me super duper nostalgic and I went ahead and listened to a lot of L'Arc~en~Ciel songs. I decided to listen to one of their latest concert DVDs as it's been a while since I've listened to one of those. Good stuff.

3. **Muse** (+)
    I used to be part of a server of a friend's and originally it was a *lynch* (a Japanese rock band) fangirl server but it slowly devolved to Bowie and Muse. There have been a couple songs that I've liked from Muse but it's only until now that I've listened to more of their songs.

4. **My Chemical Romance** (+2)
    Similar to L'Arc~en~Ciel, the lead sing of MCR, Gerard Way, released a song recently. It makes me long for the days of MCR. However, this was definitely a case of shuffling my library and MCR holding a good chunk of my library.

5. **HYDE** (+)
    HYDE's new singles are very VAMPS/666 era-like. I won't complain because I feel like rock is thriving in Japan thanks to musicians like HYDE BUT OH MY GOD WHAT I WOULD DO FOR A *ROENTGEN* PART 2. I know that whatever genre *Roentgen* is isn't really mainstream or commercial but it is a beautiful album. But I do like HYDE's other albums too.

6. **Joanna Newsom** (+3)
    I recently imported Spotify songs into *foobar2000*, the music player I used to use all the time before Spotify came around. So I can easily listen to more Joanna Newsom now, thankfully. I *still* have to listen to the *Divers* album.

7. **ギルガメッシュ (girugamesh)** (+)
    Girugamesh is another band that takes up a lot of my library. I never really listened to them that much. They do have quite a lot of bangers, however.

8. **Björk** (+)
    Björk AKA my queen. I am listening to quite a lot of oldies but goodies these past couple of weeks.

9. **Green Day** (-6)
    How the mighty fall. I love Green Day but not that much. I definitely toned down on the Green Day.

10. **Metric** (+)
    This is a result of my playlist repetition. I have like three or four songs on my most heavily listened playlist.

### Top 10 Albums

{{<figure src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dvozrk6m8/image/upload/v1541376450/top_albums_nn1tre.png" title="Top 10 Albums">}}

1. **Coheed and Cambria — In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3** (+5)
    Curious. I'm surprised this is at number one. It's not that many scrobbles, however.

2. **Muse — The Resistance** (+)
    I listened to this album for the first time and it's pretty good. I really like Muse's sound. It sound futuristic and oh man, is it politically charged. I like it.

3. **Coheed and Cambria — The Afterman: Ascension** (-1)
    Still hyped about Coheed apparently.

4. **Coheed and Cambria — Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV: Volume 1** (+2)
    Yup. More Coheed!

5. **L'Arc~en~Ciel — 25th L'Anniversary Live** (+)
    This album is long. This doesn't even include "interviews" between songs. I just realized this setlist doesn't have *Flower* in it. That's so weird.

6. **L'Arc~en~Ciel — 15th L'Anniversary Live** (+)
    In terms of quality, I think I like 15th more than 25th. 25th has a really diverse setlist but the concert was a lot more tighter and intimated in this L'Anniversary.

7. **Joanna Newsom — Ys** (-)
    Joanna you beautiful songstress. I love you!

8. **My Chemical Romance — The Black Parade** (+)
    Ah, yes, the emo bible for all emo kids back in 2006/2007. I loved this album so much. I'm not sure how much of it I still love now but it's pretty good even now.

9. **Sharon Van Etten — Epic** (+)
    I can't keep away from this album, or rather, a couple songs from this album.

10. **EMI MARIA — EUPHORIA** (+)
    Oooh, this one is interesting. EMI MARIA is a half-Japanese J-pop singer. She's a bit more innovative in her sound, which I like. Some of it is a bit outdated but I dig it. *EUPHORIA* is a solid album.

### Top 10 Songs

{{<figure src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dvozrk6m8/image/upload/v1541376450/top_tracks_ttd3n5.png" title="Top 10 songs">}}

1. **Muse — Uprising** (+)
    This song is so cool. I love the futuristic sounding synths. The guitar when it mimicks "come on!" is amazing. *They will not force us. They will stop degrading us. They will not control us. We will be victorious.*

2. **Coheed and Cambria — Domino the Destitute** (+1)
    This song is still a banger. That is all.

3. **Coheed and Cambria — Crossing the Frame** (+7)
    Good jam. *I'm spying on you Newoooo.*

4. **Frank Carter & The Rattlesnakes — Neon Rust** (+4)
    Listened to this a little more compared to last week. Good song!

5. **Coheed and Cambria — No World For Tomorrow** (-1)
    Still don't understand how NWFT isn't an absolute banger to some people. I love it.

6. **Sharon Van Etten — A Crime** (-)
    I hope I never grow tired of this song because it is beautiful x2. I'm surprised this is still at #6 for the second week in a row.

7. **Coheed and Cambria — A Favor House Atlantic** (-)
    Another song that hasn't changed in ranking this week. Nice.

8. **Metric — Dressed to Suppress** (+)
    I keep procrastinating on listening to Metric's new songs and here I am, listening to their old single over and over again like a blob.

9. **Mystery Skulls — Ghost** (+)
    This song is so catchy it's dangerous.

10. **Coheed and Cambria — The Crowing** (+)
    Instant chills on the first riff of this song. I do not know what Claudio is singing about in this song whatsoever. *Pray you're not the only one.*
