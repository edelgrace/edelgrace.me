## Goodbye Pure-Orenji

Pure-Orenji.info expired. It was a good three year run. I'm sad to see it go but at the same time, it would have happened eventually, so why draw out the process? I guess I'm mostly sad over the fact that it was my first domain. I wanted to keep it forever but I grew out of it pretty quick. Hopefully the domains I have now will last me as long, or even longer! As for Brokenphrases, I'm still not sure of it's fate...

## Card for Card?

In other matters, I entered the world of online TCGs (Trading Card Games) again. These kinds aren't like the ones where you get a bunch of cards and then proceed to battle other players with said cards. Instead, these TCGs are purely for collecting. You can play various games like hangman to get cards and, of course, trade with others for cards! It's really fun, if not time consuming. Currently I'm part of BL and Sailor Moon TCG s.

## Rooster... Teeth?

One night I was browsing YouTube videos and I magically happened to come across a _Rage Quit_ video. Basically they're videos of someone playing a game and getting mad at it. It's funnier once you see it.

I spent the rest of the night watching other Rage Quit videos and browsed the other videos on the channel. What channel was it? [Rooster Teeth][1], of course! They're a company that specializes in making media for the Internet. From animated series to podcasts to [## Goodbye Pure-Orenji

All of the employees have so much personality it's great. The downside is that they post new videos every day. My productivity has gone downhill.

## A New Phone!

I have a new phone. It's a shiny smartphone, a Samsung Galaxy Ace II, I believe. It's pretty nice and does fancy things but it's hard to get used to as an avid iPod touch user. I have to say though, pretty much all of the Androids apps are way better and prettier than the iOS versions. Especially the WordPress app!

## That Time of Year Again

Exams. Ugh. So far they aren't doing so well. My productivity is at an all time low. Like no really, I have never been this unproductive ever. It's kind of scary, I'm losing motivation and some of the things I used to like to do just aren't as fun anymore. I'll get through it though, I always do!
