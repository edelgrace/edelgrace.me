Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week's question is&#8230;

> Recommend one horror novel for nonhorror readers.

Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein*. I can only say that because that's the only horror novel that I've ever read. But it's a classic for a reason. It's also interesting how the original story is as there's been so many interpretations and spin offs. I really enjoyed it and Shelley is a wonderful author. I think it's the right amount of "kinda horror but not really horror." In those times, the concept of reanimating a human body would be horrific. Unfortunately now the idea doesn't seem so extreme. Try to read it in the eyes of someone who has never heard of zombies before!
