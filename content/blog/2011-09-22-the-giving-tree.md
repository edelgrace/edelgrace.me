Today the classes were shorter by about 20 minutes each because there was a mass today. Fun stuff.

In spare we watched half of WALL-E in the bandroom. I haven't seen it before and so far, I love it! It's just so ridiculously cute. Also, it shows a really good message. Maybe one day Earth will be covered in trash and we will have to live in space and gradually get fatter with each generation, haha! I wish we could have finished the whole movie in one go. There's always tomorrow I guess.

Because of math, there was no TA! Thursdays is our TA snack day so I was kinda disappointed. I look forward to our snack days. On those days, someone brings in a snack for the whole TA. When it's my turn, I'm defs buying Timbits. To those who don't know, Timbits are basically doughnut holes from Tim Hortons. It's a shame that Tim Hortons is a Canadian restuarant but at least we have something purely Canadian just for us. It's like Starbucks but Canadian. And with lots of doughnuts. Some people don't know what they're missing out on.

In math Mitchell and Mario came to class half an hour late because they forgot there was a mass. I forgot to laugh at them. Oh well.

Because class is short, we had to go to our period one, two, and three classes. I carried all my books, which were insanely heavy. Guuuhh. I wish I was strong.

The mass went pretty well. Everyone was confused about standing up and sitting down, because even though our school is Catholic, at least 99% of the kids are atheists or non-practicing Catholics. I always stood up or sat down first purely out of habit. Good thing I sat at the back or I would have been embarassed. As usual, the drama 30 kids acted out the homily. This kid named Ben read _The Giving Tree_ outloud while the rest of the drama kids re-enacted it. It was pretty touching. Ben did an amazing job at telling the story. His voices for each stage of the boy's life was hilarious. Yeah, that was the first homily that I liked from the drama department.

One of my friends was picked to give out the eucharist, and when I came to receive it from her, I looked at her, and smiled and she smiled back (you have to be completely poker face, and I'm horrible at being poker face). I wanted to laugh and barely got out an "Amen". Opps. I feel like I should go to confession for that.
