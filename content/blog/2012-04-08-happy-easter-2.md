Lent is finally over. :) My journey with no interent was... Not very successful but I managed to go by with minimal (emphasis on minimal) internet. I mostly dedicated myself to YouTube on the "play all" function so that was interesting. It's weird because I had the strongest urge to blog throughout the forty days. Very odd, I thought I would just forget about it but it wasn't the case at all. I actually started writing blog posts that I intended to post for later.

So what's new with my life? Absolutely nothing. I'm really getting my butt kicked in everything schoool related. Not literally. But that's not new, I'm always getting my butt kicked! I just need to pick up the pace and spring break seems like the greatest oppurtunity to catch up and get on my study horse again.

Here's my little to-do list for the break:

1. Study for a calculus test.
  
2. Trig review questions.
  
3. Physics homework from last week.
  
4. Activity guide on democracy.
  
5. 130+ questions on _Wuthering Heights_.
  
6. Start and finish reading _Heart of Darkness_.
  
7. Start reading _Kafka on the Shore_.

Yeah. I think there's more actually but the most daunting task is those questions on _Wuthering Heights_. I'm currently avoiding it but sooner or later I have to do it. I guess looking at that list is motivation in itself. Also, I want to get this done and over with so I have the rest of the break to do whatever I want (sitting at the computer, watching TV, playing video games, and more, haha) instead of doing everything I want first and then staying up until 3 in the morning the day before I go back to school.

On another note, today is my mother's birthday today! She's 53 today. It's interesting how we (we as in teenagers, which I know doesn't apply to all of you out there) get so caught up in our own lives and our growing up but we don't really notice our parent(s)/guardian(s) growing older. Suddenly I notice the wrinkles, the knobby hands, the slightly bent back, and the strands of grey hair. Needless to say, I'm starting to appreciate my mom a whole lot more. Happy birthday mom!
