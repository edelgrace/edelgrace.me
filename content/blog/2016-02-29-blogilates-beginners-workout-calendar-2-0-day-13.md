### Day 13: Total Body

### Video 1: 5 Minute Fat Burner

"Five minutes? Easy peasey." I was so wrong! Cassey wasn't lying when she said it would be tough. This was a hard video, with lots of suffering included (guaranteed).

</div>

  * _Star Jump:_ These were really hard to do quietly. I definitely started sweating immediately with this move.
  * _In and Out Donkey Kicks:_ All of my workout times are too inconvenient for the people in my house, haha. I tried to be really quiet so I didn't do the kicks too forcefully. I'd love to be able to do these moves without worrying about sound.
  * _Burpees:_ I did the silent burpee version but I did add the push up. This really made me start breathing heavily. I hate burpees so much!
  * _Mountain Climbers:_ My feet kept slipping on the rug, haha. This was kind of fun and quick although it was pretty hard!
  * _Split Squat Jumps:_ I'm sure my parents were grumbling as I was doing this move. I tried my best not to jump too high but it's inevitable to make some noise whenever jumping is involved.

### Video 2: Push Plank Challenger

This video is essentially just one move. One. Excruciating. Move. I did the "beginner's" version of this move but I still had trouble. My arms are sore after that! I'm really weak... Thank goodness for this calendar!

### Video 3: Killer Legs

Another short video, which is interesting... Short but KILLER, as the title would suggest. This is another video that depends on reps over a period of time. So much repetition today!

  * _Narrow Squat Slider:_ This move is harder than the other move, which is interesting. My legs were really feeling this one.
  * _Narrow Squat Lifter:_ I don't know why it's easier to lift than to simply extend me leg to the side... Maybe I didn't lift my leg high enough although I consciously tried to lift my legs as high as possible. Something to work on, probably.

### Thoughts

Three short and brutal videos today. The last video wasn't that bad but the first two definitely got beads of sweat rolling down my neck! I actually prefer that, for some reason. I love it when I sweat from working out. It feels like I'm actually doing work. I didn't work to my fullest potential today but I was trying to keep quiet. The only time I can do my workouts are early morning or late at night. Both of those times, someone is sleeping in the house. What a dilemma... I need to figure that out.
