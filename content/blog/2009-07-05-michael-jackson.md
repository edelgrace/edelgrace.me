Okay, so I'm going to rant about Michael Jackson. Here's a journal entry I made a couple days ago at my DeviantArt account.

"I have been mourning for days now. No joke. Downloading MJ songs, watching tributes, joining Facebook fan pages, watching lives, reading articles, and whatever.

He's such a beautiful man even with the white make up and the plastic surgery. You see him smile, and you think "Awww." Haha. Old man. XD

The Lisa-Marie blog post made me bawl so hard. I never knew the amount of emotional pain he was in. Of course, it's expected, right? He's fragile. No. He's human. For the first time in a while, I saw him as that. Human. A person. Not the "rapist" (which he isn't), or the "plastic man", or the "white but black guy". I saw him as a human, a father, a husband, and a son. He was just really talented.

I regret not seeing him live. Now I never will! AHH!!

Anyway.

I love the song Ben. That last verse just reflects Michael so well.

"Ben, the two of us need look no more
  
We both found what we were looking for
  
With a friend to call my own
  
I'll never be alone
  
And you my friend will see
  
You've got a friend in me

Ben, you're always running here and there
  
You feel you're not wanted anywhere
  
If you ever look behind
  
And don't like what you find
  
There's something you should know
  
You've got a place to go

I used to say
  
I and me
  
Now it's us
  
Now it's we

(I used to say
  
I and me
  
Now it's us
  
Now it's we)

Ben, most people would turn you away
  
I don't listen to a word they say
  
They don't see you as I do
  
I wish they would try to
  
I'm sure they'd think again
  
If they had a friend like Ben"

I can't listen to this song without crying TT_TT

RIP Michael Jackson. Our king of pop!"

So as you can see, I am HEARTBROKEN over Michael Jackson. What I keep asking myself is "Was it preventable?" Could anyone inetervened to stop whatever lead to his death? Why didn't anyone try harder to stop his drug use? What's going to happen to his kids? What about his tour? Oh sheesh, I'm getting stressed over this.

I'm going crazy! I love Michael to death.

So I'm going to make a HUGE tribute to Michael Jackson. Graphics wise.
