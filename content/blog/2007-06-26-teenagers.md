Much Music just premiered the music video *Teenagers* by My Chemical Romance like, a minute ago... It was good video... Good song, but where's the usual "theatrical" video??? Whatever, it was still good as always... *Teenagers* is my brother's favourite song because, in his words, "teenagers really do scare me... Like you." And then I'm like "Uh... I'm not a teenager... Yet." And my brothere is like "WHATEVER!" Haha, I love my brother, he's so cute. XD
