<a rel="_nofollow" href="http://www.coffeeaddictedwriter.com/p/blog-page.html"><br /> </a><a rel="_nofollow" href="http://www.coffeeaddictedwriter.com/p/blog-page.html">Book Blogger Hop</a> is a weekly meme run by Coffee Addicted Writer. Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week's question is&#8230;

> How far in advance do you read the books you have scheduled for review?

I don't read books "ahead of time." I just read books with no schedule in mind and review them as I go. I guess this question is geared towards the more veteran book bloggers who recieve copies of books to read. I haven't received a book to review in years and it was back when I used to win Goodreads giveaways left and right. I don't even consider myself to be a book blogger (rather, I consider myself to be a blogger who sometimes posts about books).

I would love for someone in the blogosphere to enlighten me. ðŸ™‚
