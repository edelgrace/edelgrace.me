Alright, I uploaded 1 story and 2 poems. Good that I got SOME content on. Haha. I'm working on a new fanfic and obviously my Michael Jackson tribute set.

My progress:

-Icons 65/100
  
-Layouts 5/10
  
-Headers 5/10

Those are just the things I already started. Oh wow. I am SO fast. Good thing I have a year to do this.

Anyway. The Michael Jackson memorial was so sad. I bawled. Especially during when Paris, Marlon, and Brook Shields said their little speeches. Wow. I would say more, but I would just ramble on and on.
