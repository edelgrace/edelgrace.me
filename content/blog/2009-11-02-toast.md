So I like a different guy now. Surprise surprise! Haha. He's in my TA... And he used to go to my junior high school. And another surprise, we're actually friends!! AND apparently he likes me back!! That has never happened to me in the history of me.

And because of this I am really happy. And hyper.

Anyway~ Band camp is this week! I am super excited. There is going to be a slave auction and the people who has said that they were going to buy me are so nice and will probably not do anything mean to me. Haha. Toast [guy I like] said that the person who bought him last year made him wear a dress. Aweh.

At this moment I am texting Toast. My most favourite text message I have had from him: "U make my life thank u...night". :3 Doesn't that make you just squeal!! Everyone says we look cute together. Because of the height thing. Haha. Thanks guys...

I have band practice tomorrow morning (7:30 AM FTW) so I will talk to you later =]
