Technically this is the second trip to the library this year but this is the first post about it.

Right after I finished my chemistry diploma exam on Thursday, my dad drove me to the library. I felt at home, how sad, haha. Usually I go upstairs to the teen section, but oh ho, not this time! I went straight to the adult comics section. I'm quite the rebel, I know. I mostly check to see if they have the last volume of _Mushishi_ by Yuki Urushibara. They never do, but gah, I can't help myself.

After that check, I go straight to see if there any books I haven't read in the P and M section to get my fix of Jodi Picoult and Haruki Murakami. Then I quickly scan the bookshelves to see if there's anything that's on my to-read list. After that, I head up to the teens section. I scan the shelves again and then carefully inspect the comic book shelves. I've pretty much read all the comics I want to read in the section but you never know.

Here's my library list for that day. I'm trying to lessen my loads as not to make it so intimidating to get through. And so I can minimalize the amount of books I return unread. I hate doing that...

  * **[Moon Boy (Volumes 1-3)][1] by Lee Young-You**  
    I've read a some of this series and has been curious ever since then. I saw most of the volumes on the shelves but told myself to only get the first three instead of the first seven.
  * **[Cirque du Freak (Volume 7)][2] by Darren Shan and Takahiro Arai**
  
    Although it's not a series I'm extremely devoted to, it throws in some variety into my reading.
  * **[Perfect Match][3] by Jodi Picoult**
  
    I'm on a quest to read every single Jodi Picoult book there is.
  * **[Poster Boy][4] by Dede Crane**
  
    The summary intrigued me, as I'm always a sucker for books that deal with illnesses and the such.
  * **The Truth About Delilah Blue by Tish Cohen**
  
    This has been on my to-read list for a while. I first saw it on display at Wal-Mart. I've taken it out before but it was returned untouched.
  * **Kafka on the Shore by Haruki Murakami**
  
    Another book I took out but returned it unfinished. I did start it but alas, I ran out of renewals on it. I'm a new reader of Murakami's and have only read one of his works but I thoroughly enjoyed it and have heard great reviews for this book.
