**Your favourite Dir en grey lyric and translation.**

Oh God. Don't ask me this. Brb I'll be hunting through lyric sites forever. Anyway, immediately, _我、闇とて。。。_ came in my head. Here is the translation:

_It's easy to stop breathing...but I just want to feel you just a little more
  
Will you allow me to live?
  
One bright morning, I opened my eyes and it came tears I felt like I've realized the meaning for the first time
  
Don't know why, but I feel sadness when you're near me
  
Why can't we become one?
  
I put my hands out for those words that are too fragile, even just one
  
Please give my heart something, anything like a blade sharp enough to strike you_

That whole thing right there pushes a knife right through my heart. Words are a much better substitute for a blade.

Actual lyrics? Let me go searching (again =_=). I thought of _GLASS SKIN_ but thought it was too cheesy. Then I looked at it and changed my mind.

_I open out my wings of glass
  
Up and towards the wind melted future
  
So just please don't go
  
Please don't go
  
Wanna be close to you
  
I am now forgetting even the colours of your tears and love
  
So just please don't go
  
Please don't go
  
Holding on strong to what lies ahead_

I bleed as my way of compensating everything to you
  
How heavy is blood?
  
**Happiness and Sadness lies too close**
