Here’s a picture of all the school supplies I bought for this year (and hopefully years to come). I didn’t spend a lot compared to previous years and I’m so happy. Don’t worry, I ALWAYS recycle and/or reuse my paper!

  * **Lined Paper 150 Sheets (x20)** &#8211; Walmart had each pack for $0.10. I know this paper isn’t the best quality but I can’t resist a sale. This is 3,000 sheets of paper for only $2! These will hopefully last me beyond my graduation (good thing my little brother will still be in school then).
  * **Graph Ruled Envioronote Comp Book (x8)** &#8211; These were the cheapest graph notebooks that I could find wih that many pages (80 each). I found them at my university and I’m so glad I researched before going or else I would have bought a different and expensive brand. I already started colour coding them with washi tape on the cover (no, they don’t come like that).
  * **@theOFFICE Multi-Purpose Paper 500 Sheets** &#8211; I always buy this brand, although sometimes I buy HP paper. I need a lot of paper because I’m always printing out lecture slides, letters, homework descriptions, textbook chapters, etc.
  * **Five Star 13-pocket Expanding File** &#8211; Okay, I don’t know why I put this in the picture because I actually don’t use this for school… I use it to file away letters that I receive from my penpals! My old one broke and this one is much bigger!
  * **Pencil Box** &#8211; I regret removing the sticker off the box before I saw what brand it is. It’s just a simple pencil box that slides in and out. So cheap too, compared to other pencil cases I looked at! I found this at my university bookstore.
  * **Stabilo Pens** &#8211; I’ve been using Staedtlers even before I knew studyblr was a thing (I’m not trying to sound hipster, I swear, but I _am_ trying to sound like less of a bandwagoner). I was about to buy a pack of them before I that Stabilos were NINE DOLLARS CHEAPER. I’m so cheap, do you see a trend in this list…
  * **Frixion Highlighters** &#8211; I use these only in my planner. I’ve been using these for a long time as well. Except my previous ones were running low on ink so it was time to more!
  * **Blue and Black Bic Pens** &#8211; Every single school year I buy these. $1 per pack. I either lose them or they explode in my backpack. Now that I have a pencil case (I used to just throw my pens in my backpack), I hope less of that will happen. I use these for lecture notes. I mostly use black and then I use blue to indicate that I want to use a different colour for when I rewrite those notes.
  * **Post-It Sticky Flags** &#8211; I gotta start reusing my flags because I don’t have a lot left! I usually use these in my planner and in my textbooks. Why do they cost so much? Maybe I need to start shopping somewhere else to get them for cheaper…
