Lunch break with cantaloupes and warm pandesal with cheese. I usually don’t like eating at my desk when it comes to breads, especially crumbly breads like pandesal but I was totally craving it. The pandesal here is not as good as the real  deal. I prefer the spongy and tough pandesal (less crumbs = good study food)!
