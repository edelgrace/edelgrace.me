Okay, I've been in a really "bookish" mood lately. Mostly because I've been working on getting my [book database][1] up and running. I was pretty nostalgic over the idea of "book blogs" and my unsuccessful attempt at [a book blog][2] still haunts me today. I decided: I shall blog about books. Book reviews will belong in my book database but anything else will go here. So what exactly is a book blog post that isn't a review? Memes, of course.

A meme who's concept resonates deeply with me, "book boyfriends" or as I like to call them: crushes on fictional people (because screw heteronormativity and cissexism).

So, my fictional crush for the week is:

<p style="text-align:center">
  <strong>Oshima from Kafka on the Shore by Haruki Murakami</strong>
</p>

Some fan-art of Oshima that I mostly agree with (links because I don't have the patience to ask for permission from the artists): [Lisa Ito][3], [Unknown pixiv artist][4], [Unknown artist][5].

This week, I only read three books<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-9166" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-9166">1</a></sup> and to be honest, I wasn't liking my choices! Two out of three books had characters I was indifferent about/loathed (especially the men, oh god, _especially_ the men).

Except, for one. Oshima.

Oshima is a character who works at a small privately owned library. That's a total turn on for sure. How many guys work at libraries?

Anyway, Oshima acts as a mentor for the main character, Kafka. Oshima is instantly helpful towards Kafka, who is a teenage runaway. He provides temporary shelter for Kafka, gives him a job, comforts him when he feels lost. At times, it's like Oshima goes to the ends of the earth for Kafka, a kid whom he had only known for a week. That, is admirable. Most people would call the cops or tell Kafka to scram. Not Oshima. He recognizes Kafka's running away as an act of finding himself and not as a petty rebellious phase.

Paired with his compassion, is his intellect. Of course, being a library assistant at a library, he is incredibly well read and has a thirst for knowledge. Definitely my kind of guy. He quotes from Greek myths and discusses different philosophers and tries to explain things in lengthy monologues. Half of what he says though, does seem like a bunch of non-sense that I can't wrap my head around (that's Murakami's style though). Still, you can't help be impressed.

There is one scene where Oshima slams down a pair of cissexist feminists, which I totally cheered at<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_2-9166" id="back_ajs-fn-id_2-9166">2</a></sup>. Although I don't really agree with his conception of feminism, at least we can agree that cissexism sucks and he gets extra kudos for that.

I'm not sure if this goes against him or not but Oshima is such a hipster. Totally a hipster. Who listens to Schubert? Let me rephrase: what 21 year old male who doesn't play an instrument listens to Schubert? Heck, even I don't listen to Schubert<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_3-9166" id="back_ajs-fn-id_3-9166">3</a></sup>. Plus, he's knowledgeable about Schubert and can analyze his works and oh goodness, it's all so attractive.

Lastly, it seems that Oshima is indeed physically attractive. Upon meeting Oshima for the first time, Kafka thinKs that he is a girl. I know feminine boys aren't for everyone, but I'm not picky about looks. He wears glasses, just the way I like them (wow, I feel shallow). He is young, early 20s, 21 if I recall correctly. That amplifies everything I said about him by tenfold.

Now, would I actually get along with him and him with me? Probabaly not. Thank goodness it's just a book crush.
