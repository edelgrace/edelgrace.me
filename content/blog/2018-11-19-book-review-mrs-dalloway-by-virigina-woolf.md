{{<figure src="" title="Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Woolf">}}

> *Mrs. Dalloway* was the first novel to split the atom. If the novel before *Mrs. Dalloway* aspired to immensities of scope and scale, to heroic journeys across vast landscapes, with *Mrs. Dalloway* Virginia Woolf insisted that it could also locate the enormous within the everyday; that a life of errands and party-giving was every bit as viable a subject as any life lived anywhere; and that should any human act in any novel seem unimportant, it has merely been inadequately observed. The novel as an art form has not been the same since.

I picked up *The Hours* one day at the library. I did not know what it was about when I started reading it, and it captured me immediately. The scene of Woolf at the water's edge, the stones in her pocket, made my heart drop. As I read on, I realized this was, essentially, a crossover with *Mrs. Dalloway*. I hadn't read *Mrs. Dalloway* yet. So, even though I loved *The Hours* up to that point, I put it down so as not to spoil myself.

Finally, years later, I finished *Mrs. Dalloway*.

This was a hard book to read. I actually had gotten a copy of the audiobook from Audible (no, this post is not sponsored by Audible) and while listening to it, I knew I could not **just** listen to it, I needed to devour these words on a page. I put out a hold on the book at the library and eagerly started reading right away. However, it was incredibly hard for me to read. I would read a paragraph and not know what exactly was happening.

Annette Brownings, the narrator of the audiobook, breathed so much life into Woolf's words that I ended up listening to the audiobook while I read the physical book. That could be why it took me so long to read this book. But it was a very interesting way to read it. I find that when I listen to audiobooks, my mind can tend to wander. While reading, sometimes I will have to reread sentences before they make sense. Reading and listening at the same time really anchored me and I was able to focus.

And it was great that I was able to focus on it. The characters in *Mrs. Dalloway* absolutely grabbed me. I have never loved a cast of characters more. They are all so inexplicably human. I don't know what it's like to grow old as I'm still pretty young but I could **feel** these things that the characters went through, were going through.

Woolf has a wonderful way of narrating, it seems a lot like casual conversation. Quirky enough that you could spot a Woolf novel a mile away. I adored it, plain and simple (I'm sure that's one of her quirky isms and I'm taking it!). Woolf understands life. She suffered through it. I am so glad that she left the world with her words for us to muse and contemplate over. How intriguing it is, how one can leave behind a legacy.

*If anybody could have saved me it would have been you.*
