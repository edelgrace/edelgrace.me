Before spare started, I went to the cafeteria with Sarah. While we were there, she was talking about Brad. Ack. Brad. She was saying how it just wasn't working at all. That they never hung out and that Brad was really awkwarrrrd around her. Oh my. In the back of my head I was just like, "But they were such a good couple, the best choice in boys Sarah had yet!"

Because there was Mitchell before Brad. Ugh. Mitchell. He's a good guy and all but he's a little bit of a creep. I imagine he's like Tristan (Pinoy kind). Desperate for a girlfriend and ultimately, desperate for sex. Yeah, that's the vibe I get from him.

Anyway, in TA we had TA snack. Ms. Ricketts baked us yummy cake/brownies. It was really messy since we had to use our mouths. During math I was getting it everywhere. Yuck!

I did a quiz in chemistry. First quiz of the year, whoot! I think I did pretty good. I hope so anyway, haha.
