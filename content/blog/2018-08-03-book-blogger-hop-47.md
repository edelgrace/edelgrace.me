<a rel="_nofollow" href="http://www.coffeeaddictedwriter.com/p/blog-page.html"><br /> </a><a rel="_nofollow" href="http://www.coffeeaddictedwriter.com/p/blog-page.html">Book Blogger Hop</a> is a weekly meme run by Coffee Addicted Writer. Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week's question is&#8230;

> Have you ever had a bookish, nocturnal dream? If so, please share the story. If not, have you ever had a daydream related to books? If so, please tell us about it.

Strangely enough, I can't think of any bookish dreams. When I dream, they are usually patchwork of my own memories (isn't every dream). Depending on my mental state, I can have either really great dreams that are basically my wants being visualized in a dream or the complete opposite of the world ending by some apocalyptic event.

Even though I try to picture scenes when I read books (and the really good books can make me picture things really vividly), I feel like they aren't concrete enough for that imagery in my head to appear in my dreams. 

I've probably had dreams about me being in libraries. Probably when I was younger when I libraries were more of a constant in my life. I still go to the library these days too, but I'm usually not focused on the books. I like to sit at the desk in the library and apply for jobs or concentrate on a side project or learn something. Sometimes I do browse around for books. Unfortunately, the library stacks at my local library don't leave a strong impression. I still think about my elementary school's library fondly. The tall wooden shelves filled to the brim with books is a comforting memory.
