Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week's question is&#8230;

> Do you get any books for Christmas? If so, name the titles.

I did not! It's alright though. I haven't received a book for Christmas in quite a while. Now that I think about it, I don't recall ever getting a book for Christmas. I'm sure I have, but I must have been quite young. Nowadays I just get clothes and gift cards. Which I definitely don't complain about! I hate buying clothes so it's great when people buy them for me. And gift cards are great as well when you do feel like buying your own things.
