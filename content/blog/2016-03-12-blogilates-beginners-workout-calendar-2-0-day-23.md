### Day 23: Abs

Okay I'm pretty behind. It's now past midnight, I should be doing day 25 today. I'm waking up early tomorrow so I'll have to skip out on catching up on day 24 until later in the day. Yesterday (two days ago?) I came home late with a huge head ache and immediately fell asleep. Like I came home, fell on my bed, and went to sleep! My headache was brutal.

### Video 1: Total Body Workout

These are getting easier with every video! Except for those hundreds. I still can't do them without pausing. One day I will get there (I say that every time). The leg moves were a little bit tougher today (just by a smidgen) since I had my cycling class today.

### Video 2: 6 Minutes to a Sexy Little Waist

This video wasn't that bad.

  * _Rainbow Oblique:_ A really interesting move. I felt like I over compensated with this move because I only felt it in my legs and not in my obliques. Also, Cassey looks so graceful doing this move but I'm sure I looked like a mess doing it!
  * _Windshield Wipers:_ Another one that I felt I wasn't doing properly. But I did feel a burn, just not in the side. My legs totally felt this one.
  * _Waist Whittlers:_ I find these really hard! I could not do these with the modification. And it took a while to actually get it properly. These killed me!

### Video 3: Quick Ab Workout

"Quick." It felt like eternity! I'm not a huge fan of long repetitions, I really like it when there's variety in the moves. This video is essentially two move: double leg lift and criss cross. The double leg lift was hard and I could not do it without the beginner's modification. My back keeps wanting to arch and create that hollow. When I tried to flatten my back out, I definitely felt my abs. Which is what was supposed to happen! As for the criss cross, I could only do four without feeling pain already. I had to pause a couple of times but strangely, I found these easier to do.
