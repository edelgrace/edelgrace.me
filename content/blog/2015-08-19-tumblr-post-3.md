I’m in the middle of trying out [studyign][2]{.tumblelog}’s method of taking textbook notes for my algorithm design class.

This was seriously a hard section to wrap my head around. Each step of computing a convolution makes sense but the big picture escapes me right now, especially since it involves complex numbers, which I haven’t touched those in years. I’ll have to look at other references in the morning (it’s past midnight, I blame jetlag) before I rewrite my sticky notes.

Good thing one of my TAs recommended me another algorithm design textbook last year. I don’t have to dig that far to find more information! Although I’m a little sad it took me this long to finally crack it open.
