I've liked my kuya Melchor for a long time. It's been on and off, mainly due to the distance and to the fact that we've only spent maybe one and half months together out of our whole lives. Well, the crush is back.

This summer I created a Facebook account just for family because I remember my other cousin, Veverly, had one. My ulterior motive was kuya Melchor. I knew he didn't have a Facebook because the last time I visited, he said he didn't like wasting his time on stuff like that. Still, I had to try, right?

So, I made a Facebook account. Talked to a couple of relatives. Than two-ish days ago I saw something special in my suggestions. _Melchor Manalo_. I didn't think it was him at first but curiosity got the best of me and I had to click it.

The first thing I saw was, _Birthday: 03, January 1990_. My heart started racing. It was really him. He had three friend, two who are relatives, and one mutual friend (Anne Anne, of course). I checked his wall. 10 hours ago, he created the account.

10 hours ago. This can mean many things. Someone finally convinced him to get Facebook. He decided to be in the loop and get Facebook. He has a long distance girlfriend and went to get Facebook. Or maybe, just maybe, he found out I had Facebook and wanted to talk to me. It's a long shot, but I have all my hope in that last one.

To avoid impulsiveness, I waited until the next day to add him.Â I added my ate Jane, just because I wanted him to add me and not the other way around.

The next day (yesterday), he added me. _Melchor Manalo wants to be your friend_ shined at the top of my iPod screen. Of course, I clicked on confirm.

I went to his profile and saw this little message for me.

_hi!my pretty cute cousin do u remember me?ur handsome cousin melchor hehehe_

I could analyze this to death but it was nice seeing this and only this on his wall. I guess we're just good friends. But I can hope.
