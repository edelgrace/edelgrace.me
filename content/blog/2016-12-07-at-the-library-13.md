I recently made a trip to the library. Here's what I managed to grab.

**Buried in Books: A Reader's Anthology by Julie Rugg**  
There are quite a lot of books on my to-read list that I don't recall exactly why they're on the list. But I trust myself if a book is on the list. I actually culled off the more obvious ones but the ones that stayed are ones that really interest me. I like reading about reading, a little ironic but it's interesting to see how others view reading.

**Madame Tussaud by Michelle Moran**  
Yet another unknown. I think this is due to the fact that it is historical fiction involving royalty during the French Revolution.

**The Midwich Cuckoos by Jogn Wyndham**  
I've been trying to get into science fiction. I adored the sci-fi and fantasy genres when I was younger. I don't quite know what happened to my preferences. I think I got all sappy and romantic but there's no reason why science fiction can't be romantic!

**Something New by Lucy Kinsley**  
Kinsley's previous works were pretty good and I think her drawings are cute and quirky. I love the autobiographical element.

**Two Kisses for Maddy by Matthew Logelin**  
I always try to get some non-fiction into my library trips. My go to is always memoirs. I have yet to read a memoir involving children. Good luck. I do not predict dry eyes for this one.

**You Can Act on Camera by D.W. Brown**  
This one wasn't on any list but I justified it because it was such a slim volume. Seems interesting. I think the book title is lying but we'll see how Brown defends his claim.
