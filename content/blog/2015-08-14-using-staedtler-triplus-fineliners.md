My Staedtler Triplus Fineliners always ran out quickly so I stopped using them. Seeing how popular Staedtler is, I gave them another chance and they look _awesome_. Except I’m still worried they might run out fast on me again. Also, I write neater when I use nicer pens, I wonder why…

On another note, I've been using $0.03 pens for the past month no joke. I was in the Philippines and the pens there are dirt cheap. That also means that they're not really that great of quality. Why did I stop using these again? Staedtler pens are great. The quality is too much for me to handle.
