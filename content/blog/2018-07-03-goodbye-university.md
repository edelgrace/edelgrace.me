Last month, I finally graduated from university. It took me six years to finish university: one year of engineering, four years of computer science, and one year of internship. I can't believe that I've spent nearly a quarter of my life as an undergraduate.

I remember starting out my first year so optimistic. Engineering classes were so brutal and every week I resolved to start anew. But I really hated those classes except for the software and electrical course. Those two classes weren't enough to pull my grades up and I knew I had to switch out. I went with my second choice on paper but the first choice in my heart: computer science.

The secret for me to doing well was taking a reduced course load. I took four courses instead of a full course load of five courses and took spring and summer classes. Just the difference of one course made university a lot more bearable.

The first three years of university was a little rough in general. Trying to make friends was really hard for me and I started drifting apart from my high school friends. I met my boyfriend at the time and I thought that all my social woes were solved then and there. That was the biggest misconception I had. 

That relationship has since ended and even though I spent a good three years with him, I'm not devastated over it. I learned a lot about myself in that relationship. I still stand by the fact that he was a good guy but we just weren't right for each other and we both had a lot to learn about communication.

At the tail end of my relationship, I threw myself into extracurriculars. I started volunteering at the university with one of my friends. While I didn't really make many friends this way, it was a good way for me to practice socializing in a professional matter. I also started going to the Computer Science Undergraduate Society a lot more. When my ex was a part of the club and I originally went there a lot just so I could see him. Then he graduated and I went there to make some friends of my own. And I'm so glad I did!

My last year of university is what I wished every single year was like. Being with friends. Having fun with my courses. Getting good grades. It was all I could hope for.

I'm so grateful for the privilege of going to university. Here I am, sitting in the library, on the brink of tears. It's weird closing this chapter of my life and opening up a new one. Nevertheless, I am glad. Time for the next adventure.
