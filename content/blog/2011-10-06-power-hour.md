No band today! Whoo~

Yesterday, while I was walking to the band room for spare in the morning, there was two guys talking in the hallway. Suddenly this guy leaps out into the middle of the hallway, and shoots an imaginary finger gun at me. With the whole KABOOSH and everything. I looked away awkwardly as I passed the two and they laughed.

I told Shannon this and I pointed the two out in the usual hallway crowd as we headed towards our classes.

“They’re Asian, like you. Maybe it’s like some kind of Asian greeting.”

“LOL WUT.”

\*dies of laugher\*

In TA, we had TA snack. Bags of chips. Yes. Antonio gave me his. Omnomnom.

All day, all I could think about was Power Hour after school. Power Hour is a yearly presentation for the grade twelves about post secondary. It was a really informative presentation but I just left the school feeling so overwhelmed, not that I'm not overwhelmed already. Yeah. Especially the 80% average for engineering. I'm going to try my best.

I ranted a bit on Tumblr.

Now I’m freaking out about getting good grades.
  
My family is making feel stupid for not making honor roll for half of high school.
  
The scholarships available sound so impossible to attain.
  
I don’t do any volunteer work. If I start volunteering now, they’ll probably just write me off as only doing volunteer work to get scholarships.
  
My only extracurricular activity is band but I’m not in marching band which probably is more impressive than just band.
  
I’m not close with any teachers so idk what teacher could give me any references.
  
And I’m not even entirely sure if I want to go into engineering.
  
I don’t even understand the terms like a degree, masters, etc.

I’m for sure going to see a counsellor next week.

School is stressful.

Now excuse me while I study for math and chem.</em>

Here's how my friends responded:

Maria (First year bio student, former trumpet):

> Scholarship people aren’t going to do that, I promise. If you have the time to volunteer and join clubs, just do it. As for uni, dont stress too much. For registering, pick something asap, but you can easily switch out if its not for you any time.

Dylan (ginger):

> Don’t even worry. I am as overwhelmed as you. I didn’t even go and I feel that way. Fucking school and grades and job and life.

I'm a worry wart.
