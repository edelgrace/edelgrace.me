Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week's question is&#8230;

> Have you ever found yourself acting like a favorite character in a novel? If so, which one?
 
Not at all! The only time I find myself acting like anyone other than myself is if I'm acting like my friends as a result of months of exposure to their quirks and traits. I rarely spend that much time with a character, even if I'm reading a series.

There have been times when I thought to myself, "I wish I could act like that character" or "I wish I could be more like that character" but I rarely act on it. If I do, it's usually more of a universal trait rather than a specific trait that makes a character unique. For example, sometimes I wish I was as brave as some characters. But many characters are brave and they are hardly unique for being so. In conclusion, the answer is no.
