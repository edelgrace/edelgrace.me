I just moved into my shiny new Filofax: a personal sized Woodlands named Ainsley. I spent the day before Christmas Eve and Christmas Eve printing out my custom inserts. I'm not 100% happy with them. Good thing I didn't print out the whole year and only printed this a semester worth of them. So this is my first week using them! Not a lot happened (besides from parties and the like) so there's not a lot written in there.

I'm not into decorating (my reasons are similar to my first two [reasons why I don't use makeup][1]) so future "my week" posts will be quite bland.

So here we go! :D

And a preview of this week... School is starting. :( Tomorrow I'm going to the university to do all my errands. My wallet is going to cry.
