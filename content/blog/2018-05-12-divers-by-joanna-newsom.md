I was about to write a post about my recent trip to New York but while I was drafting it up, *Divers* by Joanna Newsom popped up in my playlist. I get distracted quite easily so I opened up Genius to take a look at the lyrics. I love Genius because it allows readers to speculate and collaborate on song meanings. Reading through the comments on Genius, I realized my interpretation of the song is didn't align to what was there. However, I haven't listened to the entire *Divers* album which probably colours my interpretation a bit differently. Therefore, I wanted to step through my interpretation of the song in it's own post.

### First Verse

> A diver is my love<br>And I am his, if I am not deceived

This first two lines sets the mood for this song. I'm instantly skeptical of the narrator's lover. She describes him as a "diver" and what comes to my mind is an image of someone who makes their living by diving into the ocean. Not only is it their living but it's their identity since that's all she mentions of him. I've read some interviews where Newsom stated that she pictured someone literally diving or falling. Interestingly enough, she also mentions bird of prey as well.

In the second line, the narrator inadvertantly reveals her doubts about her lovers true feelings. She isn't entirely sure that she is his one and only.

So in just those two lines, the diver immediately has a negative connnotation. He is preoccupied with diving and his commitment to the narrator is in question.

> Who takes one breath above for every hour below the sea

This further reinforces the fact that the lover is a diver first before all things. He spends much more time under the sea than being on land. There is distance between the diver and the narrator. It's an obstacle.

> Who gave to me a jewel<br>Worth twice this woman's life, but would cost her less<br>Than laying at low tide to see her true love phosphoresce

These couple of lines confused me at first. My first instinct was to think that the jewel in question is his love. The commenters on Genius implied that the jewel is actually a child. I accept this interpretation as there are lines further into the song talking about childbirth. For many mothers, the life of their children is valued more over their own lives.

> And in an infinite regress<br>Tell me why is the pain of birth<br>Lighter borne than the pain of death?



> I ain't saying that I loved you first<br>But I loved you best

I know we must abide
Each by the rules that bind us here:
The divers and the sailors and the women on the pier

But how do you choose your form?
How do you choose your name? How do you choose your life?
How do you choose the time you must exhale and kick and rise?

And in an infinite capsize
Like a bull tearing down the coast
Double hulls bearing double masts
I don’t know if you loved me most
But you loved me last

Recall the word you gave
To count your way across the depths of this arid world
Where you would yoke the waves and lay a bed of shining pearls

I dream it every night:
The ringing of the pail, the motes of sand dislodged, the shucking, quick and bright:
The twinned and cast off shells reveal a single heart of white

And in an infinite backslide
Ancient border, sink past the West
Like a sword at the bearer's fall
I can't claim that I knew you best
But did you know me at all?

A woman is alive, a woman is alive
You do not take her for a sign
In nacre on a stone, alone, unfaceted and fine

And never will I wed
I'll hunt the pearl of death to the bottom of my life
And ever hold my breath till I may be the diver's wife

See how the infinite divides
And the divers are not to blame
For the rift spanning distant shores
You don’t know my name
But I know yours
