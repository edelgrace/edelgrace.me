Yes, I'm all alone on this five day long weekend. My parents have banned me from going anywhere with my friends. Ahh great. I'll be alone on Valentines day D:

Anyway, I keep saying I will do things but my parents want me off the computer more and more. =/ I'm currently downloading my homework (a worksheet posted on my school website...haha).

So what's up with everyone?

I'm really tired and bored. It's only day 2 of 5.

Happy Valentines day!
