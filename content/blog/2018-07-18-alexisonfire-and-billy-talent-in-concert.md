**Disclaimer:** This is not a concert review

One of the things on my [25 before 25 bucket list](http://edelgrace.me/blog/25-before-25/) was to go see a concert. The last concert I went to when I made my bucket list was the Japanese band *Lix* at an anime convention back in 2012 (but that slipped my mind when I wrote it and I said the last concert I went to was a [My Chemical Romance concert](http://edelgrace.me/blog/my-chemical-romance-in-concert/). Technically I already fulfilled this earlier in the year when I saw a video game cover band at the same anime convention but for some reason I don't really count that as a real concert.

However, this month I saw a bunch of concerts thanks to the Calgary Stampede's Coca-Cola Stage. Every year my city hosts a stage where musicians preform at for 10 days. Usually I skip out on it because I don't like any of the musicians that attend. However, this year when they came out with the news that the band Alexisonfire was coming, I was super hyped and I knew that I just had to go.

## Alexisonfire

I watched a lot of *Much Music* on TV as a kid, which is essentially Canada's equivalent of MTV. What I really liked about *Much Music* was that they featured a lot of Canadian artists and a lot of bands. I've always been a rocker at heart and I was so glad that they were diverse and played bands alongside the more mainstream pop musicians. Now that I think about it, the mid/late 2000's seemed like a better time for bands but that's besides the point.

Every week there would be a countdown of that week's hits. Back in 2006, I distinctly remember watching Alexisonfire climbing the charts all the way up to number one with their song *This Could be Anywhere in the World*.
