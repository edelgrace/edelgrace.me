### Day 15: Total Body

My body issues seem to have improved, minus the random headaches. I tried my best to stay active and not give into my pain. I might have to go to the doctor tomorrow though, if it gets any worse. Both videos today contained moves that were not named so I'm not going to bother with going through each move.

### Video 1: 5 Minute Ab Express

5 minutes of torture... Kidding, sort of. I was able to do the majority of the moves in this video. I still struggle with Pilates stance. I know what I should be doing but the execution part, not so much. There was only one move that I really had trouble with.

### Video 2: Feel Good Soul Stretches

A lot of lunges in this stretching video. Not a fan of lunges. Also I have very bad balance. That isn't a new development but I just wanted to confirm that nothing has changed, yet.
