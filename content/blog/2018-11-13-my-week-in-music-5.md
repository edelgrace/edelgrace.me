**My week for November 02, 2018 to November 09, 2018**

1. **Coheed and Cambria** (-)
Wow, Coheed and Cambria has been #1 for five weeks in a row. I can't stop listening to them, it seems.

2. **Green Day** (+)
I have too much Green Day in my library. Maybe I need to stop putting my library on shuffle.

3. **L'Arc~en~Ciel** (+)
How does Green Day beat out L'Arc~en~Ciel in terms of RNG? I definitely have a lot more L'Arc~en~Ciel in my library compared to Green Day. I call Spotify algorithm hacks.

4. **Alexisonfire** (+2)
Nice. This is RNG I can get behind. Whenever I'd see Alexisonfire on the queue, I would usually bump it up.

5. **Amy Winehouse** (+)
Still listening to those classics.

6. **Logic** (+3)
On the weekend, I listened to Logic on loop at least twice while hanging out with friends. My brother listens to him a lot and Logic is slowly growing on me.

7. **My Chemical Romance** (+)
More RNG trickery! I do not complain, however.

8. **DIR EN GREY** (+)
Oh man. When was the last time I wrote "DIR EN GREY"? It's awesome going back to those tracks I love so much.

9. **Mashrou' Leila** (-6)
Another RNG move I can get behind. Mashrou' Leila is a good band and I need them to come out with more music ASAP.

10. **The White Stripes** (+)
I forget how I suddenly went on a White Stripes binge. I think I was reminscing about early 2000's rock music and it naturally led me to The White Stripes. I really was a bit mystified over the Meg and Jack White dynamic for a while.

### Top 10 Albums

{{<figure src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dvozrk6m8/image/upload/v1541878881/top_albums_ha2acf.png" title="Top 10 Albums">}}

1. **Coheed and Cambria — The Afterman: Ascension** (+5)
This album is too good.

2. **Logic — Under Pressure** (+)
I was barely conscious for most of the time I was listening to this album (I feel asleep to it) but I really appreciate Logic's autobiographical approach in this album. It's pretty solid.

3. **Coheed and Cambria — Vaxis I: The Unheavenly Creatures** (-1)
I can't stay away from this album, apparently. I haven't really been going out of my way to play it, except for *The Gutter* sometimes.

4. **Amy Winehouse — Back to Black** (+2)
Classiccccc. Still haven't listened to the rest of the album. I will queue it up now.

5. **Alexisonfire — Crisis** (+)
Bless this album, that got me into Alexisonfire in the first place.

6. **Green Day — Insomniac** (+)
This was the very first physical CD I ever owned. My mom bought it for me for my birthday back in elementary school. It is such a different sound but I really appreciate it in the grand scheme of Green Day's discography.

7. **Jeff Williams — RWBY Volume 1 Soundtrack** (-)
Jeff Williams is a mystery to me. He really is a great composer and his daughter really nails the vocals on the RWBY soundtracks. But I think this album is the best out of all the RWBY volumes.

8. **Green Day — American Idiot** (+)
A classic. My favourite rock opera. I love it.

9. **Green Day — Nimrod** (+)
I think I like this album as much as I love *American Idiot*. Nimrod is a little bit of a mainstream sell out according to most punks (actually, most punks don't find Green Day punk at all) but it's a pretty solid album to me.

10. **Mashrou' Leila — Ibn El Leil** (+)
I'm listening to *Bint Elkhandaq* right now. I can't believe I initially disregarded this album as Mashrou' Leila selling out but they perfectly blend that more pop sound with their indie alternative band sound on this album. They have a lot of good ones on this album.

### Top 10 Songs

{{<figure src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dvozrk6m8/image/upload/v1541878881/top_tracks_q9qjtq.png" title="Top 10 songs">}}

1. **Coheed and Cambria — The Hollow** (+)
The opener to *The Afterman: Ascension*. It's calming and soothing. Pretty short. But good.

2. **Green Day — Song of the Century** (+1)
I actually don't like this song too much but it's pretty okay from Green Day's recent era.

3. **Coheed and Cambria — The Gutter** (+7)
Bless. This. Song. It is so good. I love it. Every time I listen to it, I am just so happy to sing along.

4. **Green Day — Tight Wad Hill** (+4)
Oh man. I used to love this song from *Insomniac*! I don't understand it anymore but I have fond memories.

5. **Alexisonfire — Boiled Frogs** (-1)
One of AOF's bests. I think Wade in this song really sells it.

6. **Linkin Park — Numb** (-)
I remember when I went through a big Linkin Park phase. One time, when I went to the Philippines I bought a bootlegged Linkin Park CD which was basically just all their hits on one CD. I was too young back then to know it was a bootleg but now I know better.

7. **The Sound of Animals Fighting — On the Occasion of Wet Snow** (-)
This band really is really under my radar. I have an album of theirs, an artifact of one of the many bands one of my exes from high school introduced me to. They have a couple good songs. I might need to clear this out of my library.

8. **L'Arc~en~Ciel — AS ONE** (+)
I remember this song! It's not one of the bests from L'Arc~en~Ciel but it's still pretty good.

9. **ギルガメッシュ (Girugamesh) — FREAKS** (+)
RNG brought this song up. It's pretty good. I really like the album this song is from. Girugamesh always had that pop element to them, being a slightly nu-ish metal band. Ah, Girugamesh. RIP.

10. **The Fool — God Bless You** (+)
Wow. The Fool! They came to my city once, at out local anime convention. It was wild seeing them. I have no idea what they are doing now.
