Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week's question is&#8230;

> Do your bookshelves have books ONLY or do you also have bookish items on the shelves?

I have books, bookish items, and non-bookish items on my shelves. Actually my shelves are in a pretty sorry state. There is a lot of clutter on them and they're usually my go to place to put things when I have no idea where to put them. If I wasn't ashamed I would post a picture of my shelves but no one needs to see that!

Ideally, my shelves would only contain books. I'm not quite so sure about bookish things. I guess a handful of bookmarks would be appropriate on shelves. I want to cut down on my figurines and memorabilia so I am hesitating on putting book related objects like those on my shelves.
