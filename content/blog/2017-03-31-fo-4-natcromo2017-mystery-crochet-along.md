March is National Crochet Month. A group on Ravelry holds a series of events during the month to celebrate. One of these events is a mystery crochet along! Basically, the finished product is a mystery and parts of the pattern is slowly released throughout the month.

There were times I fell a little behind the clues but I managed to finish it off! Honestly, I find it a little bit derpy but that's part of it's charm. For my first amigurumi, it's pretty okay, in my humble opinion!

In the end, it's supposed to be a kitsune. My SO guessed it was a mouse. My brother thought it was a dog. I thought it was a fox.
