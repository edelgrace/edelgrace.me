Apparently there was band practice this morning but I totally did not know. I woke up at 9 AM to a text from Shannon around 7:30 asking me where I was. Opps.

So I arrived at the school at like 9:30. The band room was dark and I was confused. But they were just watching a movie. Sherlock Holmes to be exact. It was enjoyable.

In math we had a test. It was easy but I feel scared when I think things are easy because it makes me feel like I missed something. :S

Then we had lunch. Nothing to miss there.

Physics. I HATE PHYSICS. If that wasn't obvious enough. We has to do a quiz about math 10. I don't remember anything from math 10 so like, go away. I failed it for sure. Oh well.

Chemistry! Ah, I enjoy chemistry. We did a lab. It was pretty easy. It involved mixing two solutions into a plastic cup/calorimeter and measuring the temperature of the reaction taking place.

And then we got to go home. Wait, just kidding. I had band practice. Blah. It was supposed to start right after school but Mr. Strem or Mr. Riegel didn't show up until ten to 4. Band practice ends at 4:30. Well then. I really wanted to leave then and there, no jokes.

So yeah, that was fun. Kinda. I felt really blah because my flute skills are horrible. I'm not good at flute any more. D:

So practice ended at 4:40-ish. And then me and Shannon went to the bus. And I didn't get home until 5-ish. GARFFLE.
