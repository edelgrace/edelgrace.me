Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week's question is&#8230;

> You have just won a $100.00 Visa gift card. Will you spend the entire amount on a rare collector's edition you have always wanted, or buy several newlypublished books? Explain your choice.

For a hot moment, I wanted to buy all the editions of *Vilette* by Charlotte BrontÃ« that I could. I only have two. But I have my eye on a couple of other ones. While the editions definitely aren't rare, I still want them very badly. They are so beautiful.

But yeah, I've vowed never to buy a book just to try it ever again. I will only buy books that I have read already. This is  because I don't want to take a risk on a book I might not like, I'm trying to spend less money, and I have no room for any more books. So no newly published books for me.
