There's this one VK (visual kei) band, Versailles. I've heard of them, but haven't necessarily listened to them. I found this one PV, _[Serenade &#8211; Versailles][1]_, which is simply amazing.

Jasmine You passed away a couple of months ago. Even though I don't listen to Versailles, I was **deeply** troubled by this news. Jasmine is so beautiful and an amazing bassist. It struck me for the second time that yes, even famous people die. In the _Serenade_ PV, it just seemed so lonely. Just the four of them. Without Jasmine. The song is obviously about/for Jasmine as well so it was even sadder. Aweh, I cried my eyes out.

To continue with the sadness, I've been reading _[Koizora by Haneda Ibuki][2]_. It's incredibly sad, AND based on a true story. It made me cry the whole day yesterday. I thought only stuff like that happened in manga (even though this is manga). I couldn't bear all those things happening to me. I would want to die. But don't worry, there is a couple rays of sunlight in this story. I highly recommend it. But it's not finished scantalating yet. =/ I NEED the next chapter or I will burst.

On an entirely random note, I enjoy this picture very much.
