Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week's question is&#8230;

> Name a book that changed your life.

Busting out the big questions. This is a hard one to answer. I think that I'm still trying to find it. I have my favourite books but I'm not sure of their impact on my life. They seemed to be entertaining books rather than books that held a lot of weight.

My first inclination was to think of any self help books I've read but none come to my mind. Then I thought of my favourite book, _Villette_ by Charlotte Bronte. I relate a lot to the main character in this book and it made me extremely emotional, however I don't think I changed any more after reading it. I just really related to the character and it somehow reinforced my pessimistic outlook.

So to have an actual answer, I think the one book that changed my life was probably the very first book that I had ever read out of my own volition, even if I don't remember what that book could have been. Reading is such a big part of my life, I think my life would be very different if I had never taken up a book that I actually wanted to read and was not forced to read in school. Can you imagine a life without reading? Neither can I.
