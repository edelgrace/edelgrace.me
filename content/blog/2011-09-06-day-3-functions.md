On Friday I got my schedule changed so instead of Bio first period, I now have a spare. It was an okay period. Me and my friends just hung out in the band room talking and other hanging out things.

Math was pretty much easy. Translations of functions and such. You have to take a function like y=f(x) and move it up or down on a coordinate graph. If it's after the function it will go up or down. For example, y=f(x)-2 will move it 2 units down. If it's contained in the function, it will go left or right. Another example would be y=f(x-2) and the graph would move to the right 2 units. It was all pretty easy.

In physics I had a substitute teacher and he was pretty boring. The work booklet he gave us was really easy. I spent most of the period working on it. Sig figs, trig, and scientific notation was too easy.Â 

I liked chemistry because it was mostly all review. Naming and balancing chemical reactions. All easy stuff. I enjoy it.

We weren't allowed to eat in the band room today at lunch, it was pretty disappointing. So instead, we went outside to eat on the side of the hill. It was soooo hot outside. It's like summer finally came.
