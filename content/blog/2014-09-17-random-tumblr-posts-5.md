I write SO MUCH on Tumblr even though I have a blog sitting here just waiting to be used. I’m sorry. I’ll try to make this as painless as possible. Here are some posts I’ve made on Tumblr.

  * I was listening to an episode of a certain podcast yesterday, which was recorded around the time when Andy got a tumblr and started stirring the pot with the SJ fan community. Dylan was trying to steer away the conversation from using ableism terms and Barb told Dylan that he had "So much to learn about the world." That made me legitimately angry and sad because I really love Barb but no, you also have a lot to learn too. I wish I could be that blissfully and purposefully ignorant of all the problematic things that are going on in this world.
  * Sometimes I wish there were "readme for newbies" version for 99% of the readme files on GitHub because I’m really not that great at reading documentation and most readme files assume that I already know something but I don't and I never know what it is that I should know because I don’t know it in the first place.
  * I'm watching FMA again because I still haven't watched Brotherhood. The only thing that might disappoint me about Brotherhood is that I think L'Arc~en~Ciel isn’t on the soundtrack. Like FMA was THE reason why I listen to Japanese music today and I would be a whole different person if it wasn't for FMA and L'Arc.  
    Remember in media studies class I wrote an essay about FMA and my teacher read it out loud because she thought it was so good hahahaha good thing 90% of the class were my friends.
  * During one of my calculus lectures, we had just finished solving a problem and a girl asked my prof, "What does this number mean?" and my prof replied with, "It means nothing. It’s just a number." The girl was getting all flustered but then my prof goes on to say, "YOU are the ones who give it meaning. You are the chemists and computer scientists. I just give you the tools for you to use in your major."
  
    To be honest, this is high school math in a nut shell. People go on about how high school math is useless because they'll never need to integrate a curve but of course math will be useless to you if you don’t apply it appropriately. Ok, most people probably won’t need to know how to find the gradient of a vector if you’re a plumber or a lawyer but math IS useful in many fields. The math you learn in high school builds a foundation of skills for you if you ever need to take higher math which WILL more than likely be used in a way that will be helpful to you.
  
    I just really love this calc prof. I’ve had him twice and he's hands down one of my favourite profs at this university so far.
  * One time I went to park with my cousin who's 8 and I was pushing him on the swing and he practically yelled, "Do one big ass push!!!" Of course, a parent nearby just gave us the death stare and I didn’t say anything but I think I should have said something like, "Cousin, watch your language!" I’m going to be a horrible parent if I ever become one.
