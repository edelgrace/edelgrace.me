**Warning: Spoilers for both *Life is Strange Season 1* and *Life is Strange: Before the Storm***

In *Life is Strange Season 1*, Racher Amber is a mystery. If you walk around and talk to the locals, everyone, including those with a less than stellar personality, has nothing to say but praises about Rachel. Throughout the game, Rachel is built up to be a perfect figure and perfect to everyone you speak to. Even to those who knew her, there was an element of mystery surrounding Rachel. She kept up a certain distance from everyone but was able to draw people in with her personality.

Understandably, this made me excited and a little bit nervous for Rachel's portrayal in the prequel, *Life is Strange: Before the Storm*. Who was this person who was able to seduce all of Arcadia Bay and put all these diverse personalities under her spell?

Her first appearance in the game left me wanting. Once Rachel stepped into frame in the adult only concert, I immediately thought, "This is looks like a kid trying to look like a grownup." There is Rachel Amber, all dolled up in thick eyeliner and an outfit that looks like it should intimidate and be edgy but is a little awkward on her small frame. Here is a fifteen year old looking to impress and rebel. Not so different from Chloe who was doing the same thing but Rachel's execution was more loud and dramatic.
