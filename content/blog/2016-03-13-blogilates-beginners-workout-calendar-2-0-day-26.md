### Day 26: Abs

### Video 1: Train Insane HIIT Workout

### Video 2: Muffintop Shredder Workout

I can't remember anymore but I think I've done this video before. This video is really simple, there is just one move: the candlestick. I think I was doing it properly this time because I started to get tired and I could feel burning in my limbs and my core (I can't be as technical as Cassey, what are my obliques????).

### Video 3: Feel Good Soul Stretches

Feel good soul stretches is a fitting title for this video. There are a lot of lunge stretches in this video, which I'm not complaining about. I found that I'm not very great with balance but I'm pleased to say I didn't fall over once! That stretch was very much needed.
