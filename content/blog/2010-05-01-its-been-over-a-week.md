So it's been about 9 days since he broke up with me.
  
We haven't talked at all.
  
Ocassionally we meet eyes and turn away...
  
We walk past each other without saying a word.
  
I walk to lunch by myself now.
  
He sits at the other side of the band room.
  
On Wednesday, he was playing Outsider and other music which I loved.
  
It's almost like he's luring me with music again...
  
They say he misses me.
  
If he misses me, then why did he break it off?
