I don't miss people much. Usually when I'm away from people, I feel relieved. Relaxed. At peace. Almost happy.

However, when things go bad, there's one person I long for.

Then I realize I can't text him. I can't pull up Facebook and chat with him.

What I'm feeling is selfish. So selfish.

I wish he was here so he could help me and I could talk to him about everything. My doubts. My fears. My lack of a love and social life.

Was I one of the ones who drove him away? Did my burdens become too much for him to handle? I wish he needed me as much as I needed him. Maybe he'd still be here.

Sometimes I forget he's gone. When I realize he's gone, sometimes I forget that he's gone forever. But maybe we will meet someday. I hope so. Until then, where do I go?
