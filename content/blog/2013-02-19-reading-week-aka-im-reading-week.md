I went to the library last Saturday! Quite fitting because it is reading week at university. I'm probably the only one who takes the "reading" in reading week seriously... Anyway, here is my library haul this week in order of the books I remember first:

  * French Milk by Lucy Knisley  
    I'm always a sucker for personal memoir-like graphic novels. The cover is just too charming to not want to read it!
  * Negima! (Volume 1) by Ken Akamatsu  
    The name sounded familiar so I though, why not? I picked it up. Turns out Akamatsu is the mangaka for _Love Hina_. I predict boobs.
  * Pure by Timothy Mo  
    Not going to lie, the cover is what did it for me. So pure.
  * I Shall Not Hate by Dr. Izzeldin Abuelaish's  
    Apparently this has been on my to read list for a while. I don't know how or why but it's been on there! So I finally decided to get it.
  * The Last Unicorn by Peter S. Beagle  
    I've been looking for a book I once read in elementary. This is a possible candidate for said book.
  * The Selector of Souls by Shauna Singh Baldwin  
    My library was doing a blind date with a book thing. I thought it would be about tapestries. It's actually about India. Close enough.
  * Daughter of Xanadu by Dori Jones Yang  
    Another one that's been on my to read list for a while.

Books that I still need to add to the log:

  * Moon Boy (Volume 4)
  * Moon Boy (Volume 5)
  * Josephine: A Life of the Empress
  * The Case for God
  * A whole load more of books...

I recently got back into reading online web comics... That was definitely not a good idea...
