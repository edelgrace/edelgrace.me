My second week in my shiny new Filofax! I just realized my major design flaw with my inserts: did not label the times for the weekly part of the inserts. It's okay though, I'm not so busy that I don't have time to scribble them in.

A note about how I write stuff down:

**Half-filled square:** Attempted task but did not finish.
  
**Striked out:** Task no longer needs to be done.
  
**Arrows:** The number of arrows next to a task denotes how many days went by without doing said task.
  
**Exclamation mark:** Important task that must be done that day.
  
**Question mark:** Of very low importance and will not be done unless everything else is done OR it may or may not be able to do the task.
  
**Solid dot:** An event that happened or something I need to remember but isn't exactly a task.
