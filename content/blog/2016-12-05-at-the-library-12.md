I recently resolved not to take out any library books unless they were on my to read list. Here's what I took out on my latest trip to the library!

**Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson**  
I don't remember why or how this book got onto my to read list but I know that it's been on the list for quite a while. I was glad to see the book sitting on the shelf since I've been looking for it.

**Sputnik Sweetheart by Haruki Murakami**  
Pretty much all of Murakami's books are on my to read list. _Sputnik Sweetheart_ is no exception. Usually there are three things I always go check when I go to the library: the manga section, Jodi Picoult, and Haruki Murakami. Murakami is pretty popular so I was lucky I got a hold on this novel.

**The Secret Diaries of Charlotte Bronte by Syrie James**  
I adore the Bronte family and pretty much everything Bronte related, non-fiction or fiction, is on my to read list.
