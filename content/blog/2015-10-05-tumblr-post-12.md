It’s early morning and I’m trying to do some of my assignment that I should have started over the weekend but I was working on a group project instead. I really should learn to manage my time better. I’m a little bit bitter because my professor moved the deadline of the project from this week to next week late last night. I could have spent my time on my assignment instead! I guess you can’t do much about stuff like this…
