Brandon. It feels weird saying it. Like it really isn't his name...Hmmm. Well, stupid me, I found out that his locker is on the other side of my hallway. Haha...wow. I need some observation classes or something. He is so tall. And cute. :3

I am now playing the tuba that is more than half my size! I hope I can do it. Yeah. Right. Not. I can barely hold it.

That's all I have to say for today.

Well bye now~!
