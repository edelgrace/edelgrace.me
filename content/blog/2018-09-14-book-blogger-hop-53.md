Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week's question is&#8230;

> What author do you not read and why?

Right off the top of my head, I don't read Jodi Picoult *anymore*. I used to really like Jodi Picoult after reading *My Sister's Keeper* and I went on a binge just reading work after work. That was a mistake because I got tired of her writing very quickly. I stopped seeking her out and I don't think I would read another Jodi Picoult novel again unless someone recommends it to me. There's nothing inherently wrong with her writing (I enjoyed a lot of her novels) but they all seemed to be the same and I just had enough.

Other than Jodi Picoult, I can't really think of any other authors I don't read. I don't really discriminate by author. There are a lot of genres I don't like and therefore authors who write in those genres I don't read.
