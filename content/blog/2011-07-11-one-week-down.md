I have another week to go! I'm just ready for it all to be over. Today was a good day because during my 15 minute break, I met up with one of my friends in the hallway. He and the school marching band been in the US for a while and just came back last night so I had a good talk with him. For a moment, I forgot I had school until the bell rang for the end of the break. Tomorrow after school, I'm going to watch my school's marching band compete. Every year during Stampede, there's a marching band competition. I was in band last year and we won first place, so I hope they'll win again!

Speaking of Stampede (an annual 10 day festival/rodeo), a couple days ago, Prince William and Princess Kate came by and participated in our Stampede Parade. I didn't get to watch it but my brother did and he said the Prince William looked pretty mad, faking happiness, and/or bored throughout the whole thing. I can't say that I blame him. The man is probably tired of touring everywhere and just wants to go home.

Going on with the Stampede talk, although I'm going to the Stampede tomorrow, I'm only going to watch my friends compete. Going to the Stampede every year is expensive. You have to pay the entrance fee and then buy tickets for rides, games, and such. I'm not much of a rider but I love watching various performances and acts. I also/mostly enjoy the food. Cotton candy, sweet and salty popcorn, and mini doughnuts is a must for every year. I can eat those things any other day of the year, but it's just not the same if it's not from the Stampede grounds. My stomach is happy just thinking about it.
