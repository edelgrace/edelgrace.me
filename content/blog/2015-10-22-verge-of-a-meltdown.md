When I told my mother I didn't want to get married, she said, "It's okay, you'll find a nice husband." She misinterpreted this and thought I was worried that I wouldn't be able to find a husband. While not entirely incorrect, that wasn't the main reason. Lately, I had "men" (boys, really) falling over my feet. Truth is, I feel like I don't deserve the married life, nor would I enjoy it.

I would never want to subject another human being to living the rest of their life with a mess of a human being like me. I'm spoiled, selfish, quick to anger, lazy, messy, ugly, unhealthy, unmotivated, depressed, anxious, jealous, incompetent, etc., etc. Who would want that? I wouldn't want to live with myself either.

Sometimes I'd think of Yue and think, "What is he doing with me? What does he want from _us_?" Recently, we had established that we would just have a "casual" relationship. In other words, we were friends with benefits.

All of my "more than friends" relationships has always been must that. More than friends, but lacking that small push to be a serious committed relationship.

This little "break" from Yue is making me restless. The whole cell phone issue didn't help either... I kept getting error messages when I tried to send him a text. Turns out that his contact was linked with Skype, which gave the wrong phone number. Anyway. He's on my mind more than I'd like. I crave his touch, his voice, just the sight of him. Yesterday, I did manage to see him for a second. And I was so happy for a second.

Then there's the issue of Tyler. This guy likes me. I **want** to like him... But I just can't. We get along so well. Why don't I like him?? Is it because I'm "with" Yue right now? I don't know what to think... I've never gotten along with someone so well before. But lately, I'm finding myself a little irritated with Tyler, for the smallest things. I can't believe he texted me, "when are you going to make time for me?" That totally just rubbed me the wrong way... Like he's entitled to me? Like I'm obligated to spending time with him? Don't get me wrong with the whole sweetie, sweet tea thing.

My love life is so confusing right now.
