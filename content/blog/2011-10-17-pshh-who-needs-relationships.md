This morning, when I got to band, Sam told me that Shannon was walking around hyperventilating. I freaked out inside because I was just like, "IF AIDEN HURT(ED? omg what is grammar?) SHANNON I WILL KILL HIM."

I caught up to Shannon. Her eyes were wet and her face was red. I tried to slow her down and then she slammed a locker. She likes Voldemort or at least, she thinks she does.

I felt bad, but I was just like, "Voldemort? Really?" Voldemort is her ex who is just extremely messed up. She's those typical "emo" chicks who says she's bi just to sleep around with numerous people of both genders at the same time. I think she was using Shannon when they were first dating.

I just... I CAN'T EVEN. I was worried that Aiden like raped her or something. If that happened, I would have for sure slapped a baby (but not really).

Well, during hand we played the show opener a couple of times. I actually enjoy it. The last five bars are so pretty.

In spare I "studied" for my chem test. I checked my mark an hour ago and I got an 80% on it. I thought I seriously failed it. Thank goodness.

In TA, Brad didn't show up. I was just like ASDFGHJKL WHERE IS MY TA BUDDY?

In math we did review. Fuuuuuuuuun. But not really.

In math we kinda did review. I discovered that my calculator ran out of batteries so I had to "go to the washroom" to text people for their calculators. Alara gave me hers, lol.

Yeah the chem test. I though I failed. I'm so glad I got 80% but at the same time, I'm just like IT'S ONLY 80%. I'm so lame...

After school we played the show opener again and Jazz Police. We didn't get to test because we played right until 4:30 PM. Oh Riegel.

At the bus stop, I confessed to Shannon that I may like Brad. Which is true. I may like him. I mean, he's so cute, has a sweet personality, and just so friendly and hilarious and sweet and gahhh. To be honest, when I saw Brad at summer school and I asked him if he had a tour fling and he said it was Sarah, I felt a twinge of jealousy.

When they broke up, I couldn't help but feel a bit relieved.

But he dumped her to date this other chick which was a no-no.

But the whole drugs thing.

But the cutting thing.

But he's in grade eleven.

But he's a flirt.

But he might like someone else.

But the fact that he's my best friend's ex.

I want to fall out of like with him, and fast.
