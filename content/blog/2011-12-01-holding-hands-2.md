One of my most fondest memories of the Philippines is my cousin, Melchor. I get some post of weird feeling in my stomach and at the back of my throat whenever I think of him, hear his name, or even see his name. I love him, truly. What kind of love? I don't know, but I know it's some sort of love.

A couple of days ago, I had a dream about him. It was an innocent dream where he only made an appearance but I felt guilty afterwards. How could have I ever liked someone else other than him? No, it wasn't the thought that we were both cousins that drowned me in shame, but it was the thought that I had eyes for someone else. Pining after Dylan a year after I met Melchor was ridiculous. And then Robert, Brad, and maybe Mario.

I was on DeviantArt the other day looking at my old poems. I also looked at my old notes I made on Facebook. There was my subtle yet bold and indirect proclamations of love for the whole world to see published on the internet.

Oh it was so obvious in my written word that I was in love. Even though I was just 14 at the time, I knew I was in love.

I remember his words from when I was just 9 years old, "You're beautiful, you know that?" Even when I was 9, I remember my heart beating so loudly at those words coming from his mouth.

I long to see his face and to hear his voice. He's probably married by now but I can't help but wish that maybe, one day, I could be in his arms. Only now does my face flush with shame.
