**Disclaimer:** This "review"/blog series is NOT sponsored in any way and all opinions are entirely of my own.

My first post of 2016! This year I resolved to get healthier. That is, eat healthier and be more active! I've been hanging out on the [/r/xxfitness: Fitness for Women][1] subreddit a lot lately. Since I'm hesitant to go to the gym, someone suggested I try [Blogilates][2], ran by Cassey Ho. I browsed the site a bit and decided to try the [Beginner's Workout Calendar][3] which lasts for four weeks.

### Quick facts about Blogilates 

  * The majority of the content is free. Most of Cassey's videos are up on YouTube.
  * Subscribing to her newsletter gives you access to unique monthly workout plans.
  * There is an app, however you have to pay for her calendars but her recipes and videos are all free.
  * As far as I know, pilates is all bodyweight exercises so absolutely no equipment is needed for her videos.

### Day 1: Total Body Workout

Cassey starts off the video with some breathing techniques, for the absolute beginners to pilates (AKA me). She then goes into the following exercises:

  * _Pilates stance:_ This is one of the easier ones although my neck kinda hurt a little.
  * _Roll ups:_ Apparently one roll up is equivalent to six crunches and Cassey makes you do around four of these. I struggled with doing this properly as I really do not have the strength to lift myself up from a lying position without any support. I found this one kind of fun though.
  * _Leg stuff:_ Okay, this part was grueling! I have a tendency to painfully cramp in my legs, so I admit I did this section half-heartedly because it felt like I was constantly on the cusp of cramping up. Maybe that's just the nature of the workout but hopefully it improves soon. However, some of the moves are really graceful in this one and I really admired how pretty it looked (when Cassey did it).
  * _Cobra position:_ These moves were like something I'd expect from yoga.
  * _Elbow push ups:_ I hate push ups with a dying passion but these were not that bad. Granted, I did do the knee variant. My knees also hurt afterward. 
  * _Mermaid stretches:_ These are rather interesting. Although, I feel like I did them wrong because I didn't feel a lot of stretching going on.

### Thoughts

Man, I'm out of shape. I didn't do a lot of these exercises 100% as I'm not used to physical activity like this. However, Cassey can be really encouraging and she does offer tips on how to ease up on the difficulty if you're having trouble.

I've seen some people complain about Cassey's perkiness but I have nothing to complain about, yet. Sometimes I felt like dying and Cassey would say something like, "This isn't nothing yet!" and I found it kind of motivating. But we'll see as time goes on. I did like how Cassey would tell stories, as it (kind of) takes your mind off the fact that you feel like you're dying.

Overall, I feel sore all over but I feel really happy to have day one over and done with! Starting is always the hardest part so just getting through the first little bit is always a struggle. I've read that it only gets harder from here on in but I'm hoping that I'll be able to stick through with it all.
