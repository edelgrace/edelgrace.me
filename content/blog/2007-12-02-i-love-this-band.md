L'Arc En Ciel

they are so cool

they may be Japanese but they are stll awesome

they've been around as longs as Green Day has (but Green Day's older)

they're all 39 but they look like they're 20

i cant stop listeing to them, and my brother thinks its annoying i only know some songs by them...but my favourite is Link

[Link (Live)](http://youtube.com/watch=fJVz81O8Pi0)

this is taken from an anime festival in 2005, and they're preforming Link

i cant get over Hyde's (singer) "dancing" when he's swinging his hips back and forth, he looks like a little girl

[Flower MV](http://youtube.com/watch=zK2MGorv_N4)

this is a song called flower

i also cant get over Hyde's dancing in this, its so bad ^.^
