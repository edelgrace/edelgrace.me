> **FO** stands for "finished object." It is a term used by knitters and crocheters.

* **Yarn:** [Red Heart Scrubby](https://www.ravelry.com/yarns/library/red-heart-scrubby) (Ocean colour)
* **Pattern:** [10-Minute Soap Scrubby](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/10-minute-dish-scrubby)

I've had this yarn sitting around for a couple months now and I figured it would be a good time to finally use it. I've been suffering from dry skin lately and maybe I just need to exfoliate and moisturize more. So I scoured Ravelry for some patterns that use this yarn. I found a couple of loofahs but working with this yarn is soooo tedious that I opted for a simple "10 minute soap scrub" instead. It did not take 10 minutes, maybe around 15-20 minutes (to be fair, I was watching *Mr. Robot* while doing it).

This is actually the second one I made because I immediately used the first one when I took a shower. Whoops.
