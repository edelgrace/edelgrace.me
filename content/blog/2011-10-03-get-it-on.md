There was band this morning. Ughhh. I love band but I hate waking up. It took a couple of moments for me to fully wake up.

In spare, I just did homework. Nothing too interesting there.

In Math we got to see our marks for the latest unit test. I was seriously so freaked out that I did horrible on it because it seemed too easy. When Mr. Dutchak called me up to look at my mark, I seriously let out a sigh of relief. 94%! I've never gotten a 90% and above mark EVER in math during high school. I hope this won't be my first and last. The only bad thing is that I've set quite a high standard for myself. I expect no less than 90's from now on.

After school we tested Get It On. It went pretty badly. We had to play with the metronome and I absolutely failed. I can only keep in time visually. I kept speeding up and up and then Mr. Riegel just stopped me and said that I have to work on playing with the metronome. Ahahaha. Not going to happen. But I got an 80% so it's not that bad.
