Yes, _Pure Orenji_ is finally open! To all my previous affiliates, please note that this site is **no longer** my blog. In the future, _Brokenphrases_ will be my blog. If you are willing to change your links, then do so. If you just want to stay affiliated with Pure Orenji, that's fine as well.

I edited the network page. Everything is up except for the "Exits" page, which I will get around to eventually.

What happened? Well, my host suddenly disappeared. I got such a great price for the hosting as well! I was devastated and lost motivation to find a new host again. I've been contemplating Three Words for a long time, but I wasn't sure if it would stick around for long. Hopefully, it will!

On another note, I would fully appreciate if you guys could check out my book blog! [Room 304][1] is now my main pride and joy. I love updating it, since reading books is pretty much the only other thing that I do offline.
