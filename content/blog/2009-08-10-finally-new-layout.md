Yes! Haha. Michal Jackson time! I'm still pretty broken up about his death, but I just love looking at pictures of him! And videos... Yesterday, I even bought a Michael Jackson concert CD (haha...).

So, I just watched Up! It was really good. Except for my left ear that was blocked, and I forgot to bring glasses/put in my contacts. Ugh, my stupidness! It happens often...My memory is bad, even though I'm still young. >_<

Ueda &hearts Love // is dancing to Michael Jackson;; Smile

_"That's the time you must keep on trying
  
Smile, what's the use of crying
  
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
  
If you'll just Smile..."_

R.I.P Michael Jackson <3
