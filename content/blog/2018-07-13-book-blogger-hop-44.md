<a rel="_nofollow" href="http://www.coffeeaddictedwriter.com/p/blog-page.html"><br /> </a><a rel="_nofollow" href="http://www.coffeeaddictedwriter.com/p/blog-page.html">Book Blogger Hop</a> is a weekly meme run by Coffee Addicted Writer. Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week's question is&#8230;

> Does a cluttered blog have you not returning? By cluttered I mean too many columns, small type, too many photos, difficult to follow, etc.

Interestingly, I rarely visit blogs anymore. I only ever really visit a blog when a blog I am subscribed to pops up on my RSS reader and I feel compelled to comment on it. That being said, many of the blogs I regularly follow aren't that cluttered.

Cluttered blogs in general, definitely do turn me off. Especially when I see that a blog has a tag cloud. I thoroughly dislike tag clouds. They don't look pretty if they are sitting on a sidebar. I don't really care if you blog about "cats" the most. I just want to see what your tags are! Even then, I rarely look at tags in the first place. I feel like a lot of things that are on sidebars are mostly for the owner and not the audience. I say this even though I have similar things on my sidebar.

I also have no idea why small type is seen as an aesthetic thing nowadays. It's so hard to read! I'm not that old but surely I'm not the only one having a hard time reading small font? Thank goodness for CTRL +/-.
