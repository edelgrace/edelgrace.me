In a way, I don't want to read stories about (romantic) love anymore. Too much emphasis is put on love, whether it be on screen, in print, or just in life in general. Not that I'm saying that love isn't important, because it is important. How a character approaches love can speak volumes about their personality. But I just don't want it to be the main plot, or even a sub-plot. I just want love to be there. Just let it happen or note that it has happened already.

Love drives us but it isn't the only thing that drives us. Sometimes it's survival, sometimes it's the desire for status, sometimes it's our family, and sometime's it just not love.

Let's hear different stories. I want to hear stories of personal struggles that do not revolve around not being able to get laid. I'm not invalidating those struggles but I am tired of hearing it, of seeing it, and of reading it. I want to hear adventures in faraway lands that may or may not be real. I want to hear tales of fantasy. I want to experience something more than just love.

I guess all it boils down to is that love is overrated and while important, it's still not as important as we think it is.
