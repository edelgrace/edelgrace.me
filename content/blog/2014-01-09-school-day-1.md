So I'm starting up a new thing. "School Day." In which I write in my [Petit Collage Paris Journal from Chronicle Books][1], scan it, and post it in here. The coded bits are in the rigid form of [elian script][2]. They are mostly there in case family members get a hand on my journal and reads it (which has happened to me a lot).
