I tried to cook more during the month of May. Partly because my mother was out of the country and then cooking was left to us but also because I'm trying my best to learn how to cook. Unfortunately, most of what I cooked was pretty simple but I still managed to cook some things. I didn't take pictures of everything I cooked, although I totally should have.

**Honey Garlic Chicken Wings**

_I tried so hard and got so far but in the end, it doesn't even matter._

Jokes aside, I put a lot of time into making these chicken wings. I floured them, fried them, made the sauce, and cooked them again. It tasted horrible. My brother reassured me they were tasty and he ate most of them but I know a good honey garlic wing when I taste one. The sugar got burnt and I put way too much soy sauce. Oh well, you can't win all the time.

**Mac and Cheese from scratch**

I had tried to make mac and cheese from scratch once before. It was not great. This time around, it was absolutely delicious! We used Swiss cheese which wasn't ideal (my brother is on a low sodium diet) but it still tasted great. The cheese turned out nice and creamy as well. Would definitely make again!

**Chili Wrap**

I made chili and wrapped it up in a tortilla. Not a lot of brain power needed for this little meal but I was pleased with the results. I may have under-cooked the beans a bit. Next time I know I need to cook them for longer!
