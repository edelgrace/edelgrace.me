So now that I've moved hosts, I decided to do some spring cleaning (fall cleaning?). Right now, my databases are a mess. I have a lot of databases that aren't used and databases that are waiting to be used. I still had my old blog database, back from when Brokenphrases was my main blog. So, I decided to to import all those pages and posts here.

Now my blog post archive is pretty much complete. It was such a nostalgia trip going back and reading my old posts. A lot of them were cringe worthy, too. Mostly I just spent a lot of time clicking on links to old websites that I've mentioned in my posts. It's so weird to think that I've been blogging (on and off) for over seven years now. I really wish I could be more consistent with my posts so that I have a more clearer picture of what my life was like when I look back on them again, but life doesn't always work out the way you want it too...

Right now I'm procrastinating (as always, not much has changed in seven years). I'm kind of sick but not sick enough to warrant me staying in bed and doing nothing. Yesterday was my dad's birthday party and I spent the evening entertaining my little cousin. He is absolutely adorable! He's a little on the chubby side but I love chubby kids. He reminds me of a marshmallow! We played Checkers and Scrabble the whole night. Well... Our version of Checkers and Scrabble! We decided to bend the rules because my little cousin wasn't convinced! Regardless, it was a nice night.

I also spent a good chunk of yesterday creating a LinkedIn profile and fixing my resume. I'm a little hesitant about my resume because I don't have that much work experience but my friend promised to help me with it. There's a volunteer position open at the organization she also volunteers for and it would be nice to get more things on my resume. Plus, they need a lot of help this year. I've witnessed it first hand, my friend seems to be doing everything by herself almost! Sometimes I try to help where I can but more of the bigger things require me to in an actual volunteer position. Hopefully I can land it!

Alright, that was just a quick update. I really do need to get to work on my school things. I have a couple of lecture notes that I need to catch up on and a few readings to do. Hopefully I can bring some more non-Tumblr posts here!
