So. Dylan S. He's not an actual famous poet. Just a friend of mine. Haha. But he writes amazing stuff. He's also gorgeous. And I love him ♥! Like actually. He's helped me get over Tanner. I've helped him get over this girl he likes. So now, we like each other. I just hope it won't be Tanner all over again.

I spent Wednesday night listening to Bjork with him. It was pretty fun. Haha.

Oh, just some random stuff about him.

&#8211; Writes poems. [Tags me in his notes oftenly on Facebook]
  
&#8211; Is in grade twelve.
  
&#8211; The older brother of an ex-class mate. [Evan FTW]
  
&#8211; Went to my elementary and junior high [I always had a mini-crush on him. But until now, he was untouchable.]
  
&#8211; Plays piano, guitar, and TUBA!! [My ex-section haha]
  
&#8211; LIKES FINAL FANTASY AND KINGDOM HEARTS! [I love Japanese video games :3]
  
&#8211; **LISTENS TO BJORK** [I LOVE Bjork. If I was a man, I would love her XD It's so cool to find someone with similar music interests]
  
&#8211; He doesn't remember me from elementary or junior high
  
&#8211; He wants to eat a lot [which he does] and gain weight [which he doesn't] cause he's tried of being called anorexic.
  
&#8211; He's 5'10".
  
&#8211; As I type, I'm chatting with him right now. [Talking about MJ haha]
  
&#8211; He loves cake.
  
&#8211; He hates Keegan [I don't hate Keegan, just highly dislike him]
  
&#8211; As of today, he knows where my locker is. [I went to get out Jr High Yearbook and he followed me there lolz]
  
&#8211; I maybe, just maybe like him.
  
&#8211; According to Tanis, he "possibly" likes me [I have the text messages to prove it haha]
  
&#8211; We're going to our Jr High one day.
  
&#8211; He wants a hug XD
