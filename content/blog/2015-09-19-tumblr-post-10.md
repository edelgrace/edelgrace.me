Finished making presentation index cards. I’m really bad when it comes to public speaking so I need to prep a lot. Most group presentations I‘ve had involved “just winging it” and that _never_ goes well for me. Thank goodness we’re practicing the presentation this Monday but even the thought of practicing with my group makes my heart beat extremely fast. I just love making presentation cards even if I don’t use them during the actual presentation because the process of making them helps me remember what to say.
