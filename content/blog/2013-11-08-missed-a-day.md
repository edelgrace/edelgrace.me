Even though yesterday technically has a post, I did not post it until today. Therefore, I missed a day. Being the procrastinator that I am, I usually leave these blog posts until around 11:00pm at night, when I'm lying in bed. However, last night I was not lying in bed. Instead, I was seated in front of my brother's laptop, trying to finish an essay. My essay was not due today but I ended up staying up until 3:30 in the morning working on it.

My university has an amazing program that provides a sort of mentoring guidance relationship with an advisor. I enrolled in the program to make sure I make through my probation year without any hiccups. This is my first time writing an essay in well over a year and I knew I needed extra help with it.

So my advisor told me to bring over my first draft of my essay so that we could go over it together. I expected the worse because the review of my outline wasn't 100% spot on.

To much relief, it went okay. Call me a weird person but there's something fascinating about a typed page covered in red ink. It's an even bigger relief knowing that I'm slightly ahead and not having to torture myself on Tuesday night/Wednesday morning typing the whole thing up without proofreading. All I need to do now is retype it with all of the changes I need to make. It sounds effortless but I need to make a lot of changes.
