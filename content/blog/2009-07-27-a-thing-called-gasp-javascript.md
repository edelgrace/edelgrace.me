Yeah, I'm trying to find ways to properly display my avatars and future graphics! I'm trying to setup Lightbox, but the thing is that the "white space" is too little. I put captions underneath and it's all...um. Weird!

Any ideas? I tried to increase the padding, but it did some weird stuff (the avatar wasn't in the white space...). Does it make sense? I hope it does...

I'm working on all those projects below (see last entry) and my fanfic. Yay! I feel so happy when I write. Why did I stop again? Oh, right. School. Gah.

Anyway, my parents are forcing me to go to bed and it's barely 10 pm. Why can't I stay up later?

Well, I'm going fishing...I can't remember when, but I am so catch you later! (Haha, you get it? No? Oh...)
