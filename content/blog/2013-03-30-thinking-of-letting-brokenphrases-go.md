I let Pure-Orenji.info go because of money issues. This is not the case here. I don't think anyone (except for maybe one or two people) followed Pure Orenji back when it was a blog. During that time I was going through a weird relationship thing. Also around that time I bought Brokenphrases.info. The name "Brokenphrases" was highly inspired by my (lack of) social skills and as much as I don't like to admit it, a poem written by the other person in said relationship.

It's been almost three years since I've spoken to that person and we left on bitter terms. I should have gotten rid of Brokenphrases right there but I didn't because I was still clinging onto my feelings for that person. Even though it's been such a long time ago and I don't feel any bitterness anymore (more like awkwardness), I sometimes feel weird having Brokenphrases as a domain. It's pretty much like regularly wearing a shirt that someone you once hated gave you. It's weird.

I'm still on the fence about it. If I were to let this site go, I'd buy another domain name or merge it with another one of my websites. Any thoughts?
