My first post on my new and shiny site! Hello Broken Phrases. =] To those who don’t know, I’m Edel Grace! Pleased to meet you.

A recent obsession of mine is K-Pop. Including Koyote! I first heard them on a plane to the Philippines a year ago. I just heard news of Baekka being sick. Poor Baekka. =[ I hope he recovers soon. What? You don’t know Baekka? D: Oh my goodness! He’s the rapper from Koyote. The most recent rapper anyway. It’s so sad. He has a brain tumour and was recently discharged from the military. Apparently he has gotten surgery. I wonder how it went. All the best and prayers going out to him. <3
