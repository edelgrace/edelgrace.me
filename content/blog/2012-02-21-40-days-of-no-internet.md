Tomorrow marks the beginning of Lent. Last year I gave up Tumblr for Lent. This year I'm giving up using the Internet (minus school things). So for the next 40 days I won't be posting, commenting, reading, e-mailing, Twittering, Facebooking or anything that has to do with the Internet. My poor Neopets are going to starve to almost death (that's the the first thought that came to my mind, how sad). I'm not sure if I can do it but hopefully I can. I enjoy testing my discipline but I always feel frustrated when I'm tempted. We'll see how it goes!

Yesterday morning I got my diploma results back. In my province, anyone taking grade twelve courses have to take diplomas, which are basically just final exams.

So the mail came and I stared at the envelope. I opened it in a frenzy and just held the piece of paper. I was scared to open it. When I did, I let out a sigh of relief. I got 86% on my math diploma, well above the 75% I was expecting. My overall mark for math went down 1% which I'm thoroughly grateful for. Now chemistry is a whole different story. My mark dropped 6 whole percentages which kinda sucked but I did better than the 70% I thought I would get. I got a 78% which is decent considering <strike>how much I studied</strike> the lack of studying I did (16 hours including diploma prep).

Yeah. A lot my friends did amazingly well, which I'm kind of jealous about. Like in the 90s range! Guhh, I wish I studied harder, especially for chemistry. At least I still meet the requirements for engineering which is my main goal, as many of you already know.

I think that's it for today. Goodnight!
