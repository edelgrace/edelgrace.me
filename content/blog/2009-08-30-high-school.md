Hello! Okay so I started high school. I don't have much time to say much, but I'll try my best. Ignore spelling mistakes please.

I just found out that the guy I've been liking for the past couple of years is a complete jerk and that a character from one of my stories has a look alike in the real world. The look alike thing is the thing that concerns me more.

They look exactly alike. EXACTLY! It's creepy. Some people say it's fate but I just think it's creepy. The way they walk, they way they talk...it's all the same. I first came up with the character after a blonde version of my cousin. Read the story [here][1].

When I first saw "That Guy" on the first day of school (Thursday) I was finished taking (horrbile) pictures. My TA teacher walked us to the classroom and there outside the gym was That Guy. He smiled, nodded at Mr O'Gorman and said "Hey, Mr O'Gorman. I'm not going to be taking your social class...."

I kinda tuned out cause I was so shocked. It was so weird. Then I saw him again on Friday. Ah. He had the most killer stare ever. And the way he walked, his head up on an angle...ah. So cute. Just like my character...

Anyway, gotta go print out my schedule. Bye~
