### Day 18: Lower Body

Because I had to make up day 17 today, I broke the two workouts up throughout the day. But near the end of the day, I just did the last two videos all at once. This day's workout is surprisingly not that bad. I didn't have any trouble with the moves today which was... Weird but satisfying.

### Video 1: Pumped Up Cardio Warmup

I really like her cardio warmups! The only downside is that they are so loud! They're fun but I do have to make some slight modifications to be a little more quieter.

### Video 2: Beginner Inner Thighs

This video was a lot more easier this time! It seems like every time a video pops up again for the second or third time, it gets easier. Which is great! I must be making some sort of progress then. I still love that one girl in purple shorts who keeps smiling. She's so cute!

### Video 3: Stretching for Flexibility

If I recall correctly, Cassey doesn't really name the moves in this video so I won't list them. They're all pretty basic moves which were easy to do. Except for the bridge. I was not flexible enough to do the bridge! I tried to rest my head on the floor but head just ended up hurting. Maybe next time!
