Band practice this morning. Blargh. After practice Sarah told me that she saw Brad holding hands with some girl. She broke up with him on Friday. He sure bounces back quick.Â Since I'm in Brad's TA, I was pressed to ask him about it by Sarah.

Me: So who was the girl I saw walking you with today?
  
Brad: Which girl?
  
Me: \*laughs\* That's really bad.
  
Brad: Well, what does she look like?
  
Me: I don't remember.
  
Brad: What were we doing?
  
Me: Walking.
  
Brad: That was just some girl.

I could have totally handled that better. Oh Brad. You are an ass but a sweetie cutie pie at the same time. But seriously. I can't even. Why? Just. UGH BRAD U FRUSTRATE ME.

Spare after. We finished Sherlock Holmes. It was a good movie. The actor of Sherlock Holmes is great. The character himself is so deliciously witty.

Math we got our quizzes back. 10.5 out of 11. 95%. Excited about the awesome start. Now I just need to keep it up. Ack.

Physics we went to the library to do an online quiz/assignment. It was really lame because it was supposed to take half an hour but it really took us 70 minutes. What a waste of class. Also, I talked with Aiden. He's not that bad but I can't get past the fact that he's a stalker.

In chemistry we wrote a quiz. I think I did okay on it. I think. Erm.

At the bus stop we saw Alyssa/Alyzza. She's a grade ten girl who went to the invitation for BGMG when I was in grade ten. She's a pretty cute and chill girl. We talked about BOB and band and Miranda.

Long story short.

She thought Miranda (Shannon's ex) was her relative or something. Awkward. Haha. We laughed a lot.

And Shannon thought I said "grow a pair" to her on the bus when I really said "grow black hair". Hahahaha I have never laughed so hard.
