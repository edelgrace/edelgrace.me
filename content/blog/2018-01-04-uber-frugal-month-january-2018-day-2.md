**Today's mantra:** When you're working towards a goal, frugality isn't about what you're giving up, it's about what you're going to gain.

**Today's action:** Write your long-term goal on a piece of paper and put it in your wallet.

**Today's reading:**Â [How I Figured Out What I Want To Do With My Life (And How You Can Too!)](http://www.frugalwoods.com/2017/11/03/how-i-figured-out-what-i-want-to-do-with-my-life-and-how-you-can-too/)

## The Homework

### The Dream Bio

**My Actual Bio**

I was born in Calgary, Alberta, Canada to two Filipino immigrant parents. All my life I have always been a person who created things. I loved to write, draw, and do little crafts. One of my elementary school teachers remarked that I was "always making something." And I find that to still be true today.

I've always been a good student even though sometimes I got frequent boughts of procrastination episodes. I loved being on the computer and my love for creating extended into technology. My hobbies soon included making websites and publishing fanfiction on the Internet. Naturally this led me to getting a degree in Computer Science.

It wasn't all smooth sailing however. I originally was accepted into engineering for university. But my procrastinating ways and lack of passion for the subjects didn't result in the greatest grades. Unsure if I was going to be able to return to school, I took up a job over the summer and saved around $2k.

Thankfully I was able to transfer into Computer Science the following fall. Ever since then I've beem focused on my studies. I managed to get an internship at a great company who leads in telecommunications in my country. It was a great learning experience and I got to save a good chunk of money.

**The Dream Bio**

I am a successful software developer at a company that does not reside in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. I'm able to work remotely and this enables me to go on short travelling trips. I make decent enough money that I am FIRE'd. I alternate between work and travelling to different countries. I've spent a couple of weeks in Japan, South Korea, England, France, Italy, Spain, the U.S., Denmark, etc.

I have a small house or apartment that I can return to in my hometown, wherever that is. I'll have a cat or two or ten. At nights I sit by the window with coffee and my laptop and work on my blogging. Or I might corchet or read a good book.

**Comparison**

I'm not there yet! I need to accomplish a few things first before any of this happens. The step sI need to take are:

+ Graduate

+ Land a good paying job

+ Save a more than 50% of my paycheck

+ Spend less to compliment my saving

### Reflect back on your life at 95

I lived my life to the fullest. I got to experience many cultures, food, and ideas. I learned many things. I got to create many things. I fostered relationships with many people from many places. I managed to find the love of my life. I loved almost every second of it. I want people to know me as someone who is loving and caring but also adventurous and ambitious.

### Perform a Time Audit

I will make an effort to track my time! I currently use Google Docs to plan my day but not to track what actually happens. Will take a stab at this.
