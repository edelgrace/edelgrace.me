I'm done all the finals that I'm mostly concerned about. Ok, I'm also concerned about CPSC 231 but not as much as I was about the other two. The main reason why I'm concerned about it? I don't want to let senpai down. Lame, I know. Super lame. But I don't want to look like an idiot in front of him! It's a super easy course and if I screw it up, it's super embarrassing!

I also got a haircut that I didn't really like and I don't want to face senpaiiiiii. I guess I'll tie it up or something.

Senpai no. :( I don't want you to notice me!
