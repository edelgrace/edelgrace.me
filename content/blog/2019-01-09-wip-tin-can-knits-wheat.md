I've tried to make this scarf so many times! It's a good beginner scarf, I've heard. Just vanilla knit and purls (is all knitting just knits and purls? I'm still a newbie knitter). I haven't knitted somethianythingng since I made my first knitted FO. Knitting takes a lot longer compared to crochet so it takes a lot of patience.

I might rename this scarf from "Wheat Caramel" to "The Jack Pearson Scarf." I've been watching the Netflix/NBC TV show *This is Us* while making this scarf. I know I will probably catch up to the series before I finish this scarf but I think it would be a nice name!

The main reason why I took up this scarf was because I stumbled across a group on Ravelry, [full moon knit along](https://www.ravelry.com/groups/full-moon-knit-along). It's just a KAL that spans for a month for small projects. I have no idea if I can finish this scarf in 28 days (it is now day four) but here's hoping!
