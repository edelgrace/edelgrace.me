This morning I slept in until eight. I didn't get to school until ten-ish though. The grade tens had a band class and it was really loud.

On my way to TA, I spoke with one of the grade tens. He plays the trumpet and is in colorguard. He didn't believe it when I told him I was in grade twelve. Haha. My entire conversation with him was awkward but he seems like a decent kid. Now I need to get working on the other grade tens. It will take a while.

Band was okay. Quite fun actually. A bit.

During physics class there was a fire drill. I was kinda happy we had one. We stood outside for a good few minutes. What I really enjoyed was talking with Taya and Seth. Yeeee boi.
