**My week for October 19, 2018 to October 26, 2018**

### Top 10 Artists

{{<figure src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dvozrk6m8/image/upload/v1540665508/top_10_artists_kly9tc.png" title="Top 10 Artists">}}

1. **Coheed and Cambria** (-)
    Even though I've been making a conscious decision to not listen to as much Coheed and Cambria, I'm still listening to them quite a lot. They're too good!

2. **Vitamin String Quartet** (*)
    This came totally left field. I was looking for *In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3* on Spotify and then I found that this group covered the entire album. When I looked through their discography, they covered a lot of cool alternative/rock/indie bands from the early to mid 2000's and I went on a huge nostalgia trip. It's a shame they're only a quartet, I feel like a lot of the songs would have benefited from an entire orchestra. But yeah. Would recommend.

3. **Green Day** (+6)
    I have so much Green Day in my library, I never really noticed. Lately I've been putting my library on shuffle and just letting it ride out. Some songs don't have a lot of draw for me anymore. But similar to last week, I am still rocking out to those *American Idiot* and *Nimrod* tunes.

4. **Thrice** (*)
    Thrice is a long time favourite of mine. I saw one of my friends listening to them on Spotify one day and I just went back and listened to them on repeat for a couple of hours.

5. **Amy Winehouse** (+2)
    I don't know how I overlooked some of Amy's songs. I still need to listen to her discography.

6. **My Chemical Romance** (*)
    This is another case of putting my library on shuffle, I feel. I have so much My Chemical Romance. I'm like 99% sure I have their entire discography, bar B-sides and demos and concert versions.

7. **Eminem** (*)
    This week has just been pure nostalgia. With *Kamikaze* coming out, I went on Spotify and saved all the Eminem songs I listened to back in the day. A lot of them from *Encore*. This was another case of library shuffle and the Spotify algorithm probably picking more Eminem songs because he's popular.

8. **Alexisonfire** (*)
    More nostalgia and more library shuffle! I didn't notice a lot of Alexisonfire this week. But I do recall rocking out to *We Are the Sound* a couple of times whenever it came on. It's hard not to.

9. **Joanna Newsom** (*)
    The nostalgia trip never ends. It's a shame that Joanna doesn't put her music on Spotify. I have most of her discography anyway (*Divers* was the last album I bought) and I can listen to it offline on Spotify but it's still a barrier.

10. **Mashrou' Leila** (*)
    Wow, more nostalgia. Mashrou' Leila is definitely more recent in my music history but I haven't picked them up in a couple of months and I totally forgot how they have a bunch of great bops.

### Top 10 Albums

{{<figure src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dvozrk6m8/image/upload/v1540665508/top_10_albums_nptsxc.png" title="Top 10 Albums">}}

1. **Coheed and Cambria — Vaxis I: The Unheavenly Creatures** (-)
    I told myself not to overplay this album but I just can't stay away from it. It's a little weird how no tracks made it into my top 10 songs for this week but that might be a good thing.

2. **Coheed and Cambria — The Afterman: Ascension** (+1)
    *Domino* never gets old for me. Every time I listen to it, I can see the music video play so clearly in my head.

3. **Thrice — Vheissu** (*)
    *Vheissu* is easily my number one or number two favourite album of all time. There is no track in this album that I don't like or will ever skip. It's great from start to finish.

4. **Amy Winehouse — Back to Black** (+2)
    Not much to say about this one. Just been listening to a couple of tracks on repeat.

5. **Coheed and Cambria — In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3** (-3)
    Definitely slowly winding down on the Coheed. Mostly just listening to *A Favor House Atlantic*.

6. **Coheed and Cambria — Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV: Volume 1** (-2)
    Why is this album so good? Like, seriously. So many good songs on this album. But, still toning it down with the Coheed.

7. **Joanna Newsom — Ys** (*)
    The only reason why *Vheissu* might be number two instead of number one is because of this album. I love this album. I think it is probably Joanna's best album. It is a beautifull crafted piece of art. I love it.

8. **Coheed and Cambria — Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV: Volume 2** (*)
    Was talking to my friend about a couple tracks from this album. It's pretty underrated, I'm not sure why so many fans are "meh" about it.

9. **Protest the Hero — Fortress** (*)
    I was looking for good study music but I didn't want like strings or lo-fi beats so I tried looking up metal/rock study music. Thank god Protest the Hero released instrumentals for their songs. Surprisingly, a lot of them definitely sound a lot less energetic without vocals. What a difference it makes!

10. **Jeff Williams — RWBY Volume 1 Soundtrack** (*)
    RWBY Volume 1 has arguably the best soundtrack in the entire series. *This Will Be the Day*, *Gold*, *From Shadow*, *Mirror Mirror*, *Red Like Roses*, *I Burn*, *I May Fall*, *Wings*,... There are way too many good songs on it. The only song that I don't like from the soundtrack is probably *Red Like Roses Part II* (just kidding as I'm writing this I'm listening to it now and I like it).

### Top 10 Songs

{{<figure src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dvozrk6m8/image/upload/v1540665508/top_10_songs_koqkjp.png" title="Top 10 songs">}}

1. **Amy Winehouse — Tears Dry on Their Own** (*)
    *He walks away, the sun goes down, he takes the day but I'm grown.* Oh Amy, thank you for gracing the world with your music. I really think this is a nice and hopeful song.

2. **Thank you Scientist — Feed the Horses** (+7)
    Wow, this song went up from last week. It's a good song but I'm not entirely sure why I keep listening to it as much as I have.

3. **Coheed and Cambria — Domino the Destitute** (-1)
    This song is a banger. That is all.

4. **Coheed and Cambria — No World for Tomorrow** (*)
    Probably the best song off of the album. *Curse us, as god has.* Amazing. I would love to hear this song live one day. *There's no world for tomorrow, if we wait for today.* I remember talking about how *In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3* made me feel like a soldier marching into battle, this definitely takes that concept and amps it up a hundred times.

5. **Kero Kero Bonito — Only Acting** (-5)
    Still a good song, just haven't been listening to it as much. Time to queue it up.

6. **Sharon Van Etten — A Crime** (+1)
    I hope I never grow tired of this song because it is beautiful.

7. **Coheed and Cambria — A Favor House Atlantic** (-2)
    The other day I looked up the music video for this song. It is so ridiculous but hilarious. They definitely take a jab at Green Day with Claudio dressing up in Billie Joe's trademark black button up and red tie, it's so funny.

8. **Frank Carter & The Rattlesnakes — Neon Rust** (*)
    I really need to listen to more of their songs because this is a really good song. I just love the atmosphere of the song. The melody in the beginning is really soothing and then it builds up to the chorus. It feels a little empty until the climax but it really releases all the tension in the song. So good.

9. **Joji — SLOW DANCING IN THE DARK** (-5)
    Joji. Who hurt youuuuuuu??

10. **Coheed and Cambria — Crossing the Frame** (*)
    Good jam. *I'm spying on you Newoooo.*
