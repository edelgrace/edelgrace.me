Yesterday I went out with my SO for Vietnamese food. There's a decently sized restaurant called _Bow River Vietnamese Restaurant_ that's close by his house. I regret not taking pictures but their deep fried wontons were delicious. It had a good amount of meat and perfect crunchy crust. The sauce they provided it with was good as well.

For myself, I ordered a regular beef noodle soup. In the soup was tripe, brisket, and beef balls in it. The broth was great. I'm not a big fan of tripe so I left it in the bowl. The bowl itself was pretty big, I can't believe I almost finished everything. I feel bad for wasting food but there's just so much that they give! For drinks, I got an orange slush. Orange is my favourite drink flavour of all time and I was not disappointed. It tasted like the artificial orange flavour but any kind of orange is okay with me.

The side they have are interesting, bean sprouts and a sprig of mint. SO ate most of the bean sprouts and I regret not eating more of the mint. It was tasty, for a leaf. Weird to think about how mints are essentially just plants.

While at his house, we watched a couple episodes of _Westworld_. If you haven't heard yet, it's a TV series about a highly advanced them park that features extremely advanced and realistic AIs that roam around interacting with the humans and attending their every needs (or should I say, wants). We're only at the fourth episode right now. I'm intrigued with it although it's hard for me to figure what is really happening at any point in time. When I expressed my confusing, my SO tried to give me a hint that didn't reveal any spoilers (disclaimer, skip the rest of the paragraph if you're sensitive to spoilers). He told me that there are three distinct timelines in the story. This may have confused me further. I did notice the three different plots: rich old man's attempt to discover the secrets of the park, William on his first adventures in the park, Maeve's discovery that things aren't not what it seems in the park. I'm having trouble trying to place when each of these plots happen relative to each other. All the other events that happen in the series, I have trouble placing what happens where.

So far though, I enjoy the series. I doubted the fact that is was a Western (I'm not a really a fan of Westerns) but I was pleased when it was much more than a Western. The sci-fi element is always present in the story and you're always aware that everything is not "real." I accidentally spoiled myself looking up pictures of Thandie Newton (she is superb, I loved her in _Pursuit of Happyness_) but it only fueled my anticipation to go through the rest of the series. My SO had already watched the series and is going through watching it again with me (bless). He wasn't entirely enamored with the series but I guess he likes it enough to go through a second watching.

In the afternoon, I helped him move desks. There's a desk in the living room that he wanted to transfer into his little "office" room. His previous desk was a little small and the desk he moved in was much larger and provided more space. The surface area is definitely greater but sitting two people at that desk gets a bit cramped. I do like seeing his desk somewhat tidier though, although it is still kinda dusty.

After that I walked to Safeway to get some Starbucks. I received a gift card from one of my relatives. I love Starbucks. I only like the sugary drinks and I don't like to drink my coffee black. This time I ordered a grande caramel machiatto. It was sweet enough for me, although all the caramel drizzle may have been a bit overkill. But I enjoyed drinking it. It wasn't the first time I drank it but the first time in a while. I may buy it again, sometimes I have not encountered a drink yet to replace my ultimate favourite: white chocolate mocha.

Anyway, once I got home, I ate dinner and wrote up this blog post! It's now almost 8:30PM. I think I will spend the rest of the day studying for CCNA. Hopefully I can finish the rest of the chapter.
