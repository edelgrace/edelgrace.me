Tomorrow is the graduation ceremonies for the grade twelves. The marching band is playing, AKA me. I'm super nervous. Not nervous if performing but nervous of crying. I'm going to miss a lot of these grade twelves.

I'm going to miss him. Even more than I do now. But this will hopefully help me get over him. It's been over a month. A month. =/ I'm surprised I lasted this long with only one minor breakdown. I miss him so much. My heart aches and my stomach drops at the sight of him, the sound of him, even hearing his name.

Love is cruel.
