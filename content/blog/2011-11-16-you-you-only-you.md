I never finished the DIR EN GREY meme. I’ll finish it sooner or later. I haven’t posted in a while either. Oh no! Well, better late than never.

I rediscovered this podcast I downloaded when I just started listening to Japanese and Korean music. All Rock and No Talk by xxthrowdownxx I think it was. So yeah, I was listening to volume 12 and came across a pleasant gem.

_Stand By Me_ by The Brilliant Green. The Brilliant Green is a pop rock band fronted by Tomoko Kawase. Tomoko Kawase is most known for (or so I would think) her solo project, Tommy February6 or Tommy Heavenly6.

The first time I listened to her would either be in the Nana OST or in the podcast all those years ago.

When I was in love with L’Arc~en~Ciel, I used to go on a forum called Dive to Blue. There they shared many music and this one album featured Tetsu69, the bassist of the band. This album was a Nana tribute. Also on the album was Skye Sweetman and Tommy February6. I don’t remember what song Tommy sang. _Hey Bad Boy_? Or was that the song on the podcast? I’ll have to check. Either way, that was my first song by her.

Just recently, I rediscovered her though the anime _Paradise Kiss_ (from the creator of _Nana_). She sang the opening which was _Lonely in Gorgeous_. The song ran shivers down my spine. It was sultry, catchy, reminiscent of 80s pop, and the lyrics were practically made for the anime. Yeah, I listened to that for a long while.

But I **rere**discovered her like yesterday or so through the podcast. The Brilliant Green. The song _Stand By Me_ is amazing. Tomoko’s voice is absolutely heavenly. It’s so pure. I love it.

So I searched for more Tomoko. _Magic in Your Eyes_ was the one that stood out the most from my findings. I’ve listened to it before but it never stuck to me until now. The very first few seconds aren’t that amazing but filled with wonderful Engrish. “Come on darling close your eyes.” The bridge or chorus isn’t that great either. “Call in, if you’re my boyfriend x1000.” But the verses were absolutely HEAVENLY.
