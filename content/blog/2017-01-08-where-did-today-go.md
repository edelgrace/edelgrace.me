It's almost 3:00PM. So far today, I have done the following:

  * Went to church
  * Did my laundry
  * Cooked and ate lunch
  * Worked out for half an hour

I still have to:

  * Read the rest of chapter 1 in my CCNA3 course
  * Go through my to-do list in my bullet journal
  * Update my monthly trackers in my bullet journal
  * Work a little bit on my pomodoro app
  * Reply to my pen pal

So much to do, so little time!
