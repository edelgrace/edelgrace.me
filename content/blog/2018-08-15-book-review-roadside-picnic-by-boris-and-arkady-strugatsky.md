Recently, I've been reading more science fiction. I don't know how accurate that statement is because, really, I've just been reading a lot of Ursula K. Le Guin and John Wyndham. Both authors approach science fiction in a way that appeals more to me. They focus less on the flashy technology and the science but more on the daily and surprisingly human interactions between foreign entities. Discovering new cultures or experiencing what-if scenarios of how humans would react to certain events is what I look for in science fiction.

For some reason, I was a little dubious about *Roadside Picnic*. A friend of mine recommended this to me and it seemed like we were on the same page when it came to science fiction. I was a little worried when I learned that one of their favourite games, *S.T.A.L.K.E.R.* was based on this book. I'm not someone really interested in shooters or high-risk treasure hunts. I decided to give it a shot anyway. When I saw that Le Guin had written the foreword to *Roadside Picnic*, I was delighted. If my friend with good taste and my favourite science fiction author approved of it, it must be good, right?

I was not disappointed.

First, let me gush about Le Guin's foreword for a second. Le Guin mentions the context that this novel was written in. Censorship was rampant during this time in the Soviet Union. In the afterword, Boris Strugatsky recounts many of the violations *Roadside Picnic* managed to accumulate, ranging from acts of violence, crude language, and immoral behaviour. Le Guin so succinctly observes that science fiction (in Russia) is a way to write from freedom from Party ideology. More concisely, "They wrote as free men write."

The universe of *Roadside Picnic* is soaked with subtle details of the daily lives of stalkers and the collateral damage they leave behind. The concept of the novel is somewhat simple: aliens visited Earth and humans go into those locations to grab whatever the aliens left behind for research, profit, or both. However, it takes that and creates compelling stories from it.

While *Roadside Picnic* explores narratives from several characters, the character in the spotlight the most is Rederick Schuhart or as he is more known by, Red. By far, he is the most interesting character out of all them. When the point of view shifted to other characters, I was a bit bored (bar the one philosophical conversation that I found extremely intriguing). However, the Strugatsky brothers accomplished something in that although I was bored, the content was still important in contributing to the story.

This book, overall, was just a lot of fun. It is a quick read and although it took me a week to get through it, I found myself flipping pages frantically. I did not want to put it down (it doesn't help that when I read, I usually read on the commute and I can't stay on a train forever).

An interesting thing that I really liked about this novel was just how Russian it is. When I think dystopian, I think of *We* by Yevgeny Zamyatin. I remember reading a review of *Roadside Picnic* that compares the two. They are entirely but they both are extremely Russian. I don't know what it is, but Russian authors have such a distinct voice that I am completely enamoured with. From Nabokav to Bulgakov to Dostoyevsky... I think I can now add the Strugatsky brothers to my list of Russian authors that I admire.
