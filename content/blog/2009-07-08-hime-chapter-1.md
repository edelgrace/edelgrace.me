Synopsis: Never mix work with love. It only ends in disapointment.

My fingers shook as I thrusted the small box into your face. "Please accept this," I said, my face burning as I looked down at the floor. For what seemed like an hour, I stood there, waiting for your reply.

Then I felt the box lift from my fingers. "Hime," You say in a soft voice. My head lifted to see your reaction. You twirl the present in your hands, inspecting every single crease and fold of the wrapping. My cheeks burned. I spent two hours trying to wrap it. The slightest mistake made me tear the paper off and start all over again.

"Hime, I can't accept this," Your long, thick fingers grabbed my hand, and softly placed the box into my palm. They forced my hand closed.

I drew the box close to me. "Wh-why not?" I could already feel the tears forming.

You just shake your head. "The Johnnys won't like it."

"How will they know? It's just chocolate," My voice raised up a notch. I could feel it melting in the box.

"And I'm sure it tastes good," An unconvincing smile spreads across your face. It quickly disappeared as soon as the tears started streaming. "Hime, like you just said, it's just chocolate. It doesn't mean anything, right? Right?"

I hoped that repetition didn't mean anything. So I just nodded and rubbed my eyes.

You pat my head. "Good, Hime."

I stared after you as you walked away. If you have no feelings for me then why do you insist on calling me princess?

I drew the covers up to my chin. The bed shook as the bus pulled out of the stadium. Above me, Koki grumbled and turned over to his side. With my back flat against the wall of the bunker, I listened to the soft snores that seemed to be everywhere. I gazed anxiously at the thin curtain in front of me, trying to see through it. Trying to see if you were awake.

Seeing nothing but darkness, I buried my head into my pillow. I wasn't sleepy at all, and it was pretty hard to sleep sitting up&#8211;for me anyway. Since I had nothing better to do, I examined the thin fibres, the strands, the makings of the cloth.

I was totally absorbed into this, the intricate lines made my head swirl. Then, "Ueda-kun," a voice whispered in the dark. "Ueda-kun, are you awake?"

My head jolted up. "Jin," I nearly cried out, but still a bit too loud. My heart pounded.

"Go to sleep," he replied. A few grumbles and then I heard nothing else from him for the entire night.

Jin's P.O.V.

The day I found out that I was interviewing her, I nearly cried of nervousness (while trying to keep my alleged calm composure). I freaked out because she was my idol, but mainly because of her innocent smile. It burned me down to the core. And I knew that if she ever flashed that smile at me, I would die.

Ueda on the other hand, just smiled wearily and gave me a "good luck." At that moment I didn't feel so excited anymore. He worshipped the ground she walked on, the air that she breathed. Plus, he would kill to have her flash that smile in his direction any day.

But this is my job. So I don't have any other choice. Unless of course, I wanted to get fired.
