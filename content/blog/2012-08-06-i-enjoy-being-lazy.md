Currently I'm writing to you from my shiny new WordPress app on my iPod! I'm seriously grateful for the WordPress app. I do 90% of my blogging on my iPod anyway. The only mobile thing about the admin section of WordPress is the login page. Typing long things in Safari is a pain as well. It crashes way too often in Safari. Plus, this app is just distraction free. When you're typing, it's just that: you typing. A blank white screen just itching to be filled with words. Of course it wouldn't be complete without some HTML shortcuts. They could be handy but I usually do my HTML formatting myself.

<div style="padding:0px 10px 10px 10px;float:left;">

One of the best things about this app is that it works offline too. It can save drafts locally onto the iPod and as soon as it is connected to the Internet it will be uploaded onto your website. Did I mention that it can work with self hosted sites and WordPress.com sites as well?

Anyway, enough about apps. Summer has been deliciously lazy. All I've been doing is playing video games and surfing the Internet. Of course, I've done some "productive things" like revamping layouts, and finishing up Fanlistings but that's still lazy stuff.

My biggest accomplishment is finishing three video games. Not 100% perfect but you know the deal. I know that's kind of sad but i usually it takes me months to finish a video game. I finished three video games in less than a month. Of course, it was the Assassin's Creed Ezio trilogy games that I finished: _Assassin's Creed II_, _Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood_, and _Assassin's Creed: Revelations_. I really love that series. Sometimes I confuse the games for each other but it's understandable considering the fact that I played them all one after the other. It's almost my perfect ideal game, almost! AC3 is coming out this October and I seriously cannot wait. Sadly, I'm too broke to preorder it though.

I'm not really a gamer. I'm a casual gamer. I like stuff like Sims and Sly Cooper and girly dating sims. So finding a video game that I like that's out of my boundaries is a rare event. The series is just perfect. Awesome yet not too hard gameplay, huge open world, beautiful graphics, detailed designs, complex storylines, a pinch of history, awesome soundtrack, badass characters... Pretty much everything I would like in a game is in this series.
