**My week for October 12, 2018 to October 19, 2018**

### Top 10 Artists

{{<figure src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dvozrk6m8/image/upload/v1540131697/top_10_artists_bszezk.png" title="Top 10 Artists">}}

1. **Coheed and Cambria** (-)
    I'm still riding that Coheed and Cambria hype. I'm trying *so hard* not to be listening to them 24/7. I just want to play their new album over an over again!

2. **Metric** (*)
    I have been playing a couple of their songs over and over again. They really make me want to jump up and dance!

3. **Daughter** (*)
    This is another case of replaying a band over and over again. *Youth* is such a good song, I always feel it every single time I listen to it.

4. **椎名林檎** (+5)
    Shiina Ringo came out with a song recently-ish and her catalog is now on Spotify. So I've been listening to a lot of her this week.

5. **boy pablo** (-4)
    My boy, Pablo, is still a goodie but I feel like i'm listening to too much of him. I only like two of his songs (or more accurately, I've only listened to two of his songs).

6. **Kero Kero Bonito** (*)
    They released an album the same week that Coheed and Cambria released theirs and I like it a lot! *Only Acting* is my favourite from the album. I don't know how to describe it. Like a noisey grunge pop rock?

7. **Amy Winehouse** (*)
    I have no idea what triggered my Amy Winehouse resurgence. I loved her a lot back in junior high with her *Back to Black* album.

8. **Childish Gambino** (-)
    *Feels Like Summer* is still a bop even though we're well into October. And since I'm doing Sober October this month, *Sober* is my ironic song of the month. Even though the song title is "Sober" the chorus goes, "I'll never be sober." The opposite of what I want but hey, it's catchy!

9. **Green Day** (*)
    Wow, this is a surprise for me. I have no idea where this came from. I don't remember listening to this much Green Day. I did recently went through their entire catalog on Spotify and saved the songs that I like. I love a lot of their songs. It's always nostalgic listening to their songs. *Whatshername*  and *Redundant* are two songs I can think of listening to this week. So good.

10. **Joji** (-7)
    Ahhh, Joji. *SLOW DANCING IN THE DARK* is getting a little too melancholy for me. It's a good song though. I need to check out some of his other songs. There's this one song I do like but it's not on Spotify. Joji sampled and remixed a song and it's pretty good.

### Top 10 Albums

1. **Coheed and Cambria — Vaxis I: The Unheavenly Creatures** (-)
    This week Coheed is a little less dominating. But I still have been listening to a lot of them. I just can't keep my hands off *Vaxis: I*.

2. **Coheed and Cambria — In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3** (+1)
    This album is slowly growing on me. It really is a huge epic. I need to take a couple more playthroughs with this.

3. **Coheed and Cambria — The Afterman: Ascension** (+1)
    Nostalgia is really hitting me hard with this. I say this a lot but *Ascension* is definitely one of my top albums of all time. It's just so good.

4. **Coheed and Cambria — Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV: I** (-2)
    I don't want to wear out *Good Apollo I* too much. This album is another nostalgic classic.

5. **Kero Kero Bonito — Time 'n' Place** (*)
    They released this album the same week Coheed released *Vaxis I* and I love it!

6. **Amy Winehouse — Back to Black** (*)
    Really the only Amy Winehouse album that I've listened to. I need to get a proper listen though. I'm really only familiar with the singles and *Me and Mr. Jones*.

7. **Joji — SLOW DANCING IN THE DARK** (*)
    This is just a single. I'm kinda looking forward to the album? *YEAH RIGHT* was a little iffy but I'm optimistic for the rest of the album.

8. **The Front Bottoms — Talon of the Hawk** (*)
    One of my friends introduced me to this band and I really like them unironically. The vocalist has such a weird voice that I don't think is that good but it adds character. It's really folksy and it works for this band.

9. **Sharon Van Etten — Epic** (*)
    Oh man, why didn't I find about Sharon Van Etten earlier? *Epic* is a heartbreaking album. It details an abusive relationship Etten went through and her lyricism is  just so beautifully tragic. I love her.

10. **Mystery Skulls — Forever** (*)
    This band came up on my Discovery Weekly playlist, if I recall correctly. *Forever* is a decent album but there are a couple of standouts. One of my friends showed me the music video for *Ghost* and it's great. They recently came out with another music video and my favourite song from the album, *Every Note* is featured for like thirty seconds on it.

### Top 10 Songs

{{<figure src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dvozrk6m8/image/upload/v1540131697/top_10_songs_jyecki.png" title="Top 10 songs">}}

1. **Kero Kero Bonito — Only Acting** (*)
    *I thought I was only acting but I felt exactly like it was all for real.* This song is so fun! I love it. I love the noisey grunge and the glitchy 80's/90's aesthetic.

2. **Coheed and Cambria — Domino the Destitute** (*)
    Definitely one of Coheed's best songs. I'm so surprised they don't play it more often in their shows. It's just so... Hard hitting. I get chills up my spine when I listen to it.

3. **Coheed and Cambria — Evagria the Faithful** (*)
    I've spoken about *Evagria* before but I love this song. It's groovy and funky and haunting. They really nailed the prog elements in this song.

4. **Joji — SLOW DANCING IN THE DARK** (*)
    A small part of me is a little weirded out at how depressing Joji's songs are. Who hurt you Joji, who hurt you? But it makes for good songs.

5. **Coheed and Cambria — A Favour House Atlantic** (*)
    This is a poppy bop and a fun one to listen to live. *Good eye, sniper. Now I shoot, you run!*

6. **Coheed and Cambria — The Dark Sentencer** (-3)
    This song is slowly wearing out for me. But it's a good opener to a great album and a good head banger.

7. **Sharon Van Etten — A Crime** (*)
    *To say the things I want to say to you would be a crime/To admit I'm still in love with you after all this time/I'd rather let you touch my arm until you die.* Ahhh. Sharon Van Etten! Who hurt you?? It's such a beautiful and painful song. I love it.

8. **boy pablo — Everytime** (*)
    The song that started it all for these boys. It's really mellow.

9. **Thank you Scientist — Feed the Horses** (*)
    This band is on the record label that the frontman of Coheed and Cambria founded. They are so proggy, I enjoy it. They have a lot of jazz elements which is pretty cool.

10. **Mystery Skulls — Ghost** (*)
    Such. A. Bop. I want to sing along to it all the time. When I'm in the office and this comes on, I definitely start mouthing the lyrics.
