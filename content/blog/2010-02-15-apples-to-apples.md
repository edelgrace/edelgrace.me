I'm really pumped/hyped up/excited for the Kya! effect. Like no joke. Haha. The layout looks suweeeet. I'm thinking of adopting/renting a domain... Kya~!

To focus on my offline life... I just spent four hours at my friend's house. Yummy chips, walks to fish creek park, picture taking, and girl talks. 

I have to make sure my band teachers convince my mom about me going to California for our tour this summer. My mom won't let me go because it's too expensive ($2000) and because she "can't stand it if I left her for ten days." The money issue I can understand, but not the second issue. Really? I growing up, you have to let me go some places.
