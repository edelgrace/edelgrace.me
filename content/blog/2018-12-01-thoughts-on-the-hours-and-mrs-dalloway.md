*The Hours* is exactly the kind of book that I would expect to love. It hits all the right emotional high notes, touches on issues that resonate with me, and has decent enough prose to keep me reading. However, it pales in comparison to the novel that it pays tribute to, *Mrs. Dalloway*.

What *The Hours* does a good job at is mirroring the characters and themes in *Mrs. Dalloway*. As I was making venn diagrams comparing the two books over my lunch break, I realized just how jam-packed *Mrs. Dalloway* is. Similarily, *The Hours* is just as jam-packed.

I don't blame Cunningham for writing *The Hours*. I was similarily inspired by *Mrs. Dalloway* and wrote a small story that drew inspiration from the characters of the novel. There is something so incredibly distinct about each character that I could not help but turn over in my mind.
