I've been tinkering with Hugo lately. A couple of weeks ago, I exported my old Wordpress blog into Hugo. While I am happy with the results, it's taking me a bit of time to go through each of my posts (of which there are hundreds of) and update the metadata. I'm quite tempted to leave it as is but I enjoy consistency.

So here I am. A new portfolio. A technically new site. A new GitHub repository.

We'll see how Hugo + Github works out. Hopefully it'll be here to stay (fingers crossed that Github Pages is still a thing until my deathbed).
