I can count the number of times I have tried to make cheesecake on one hand. It's not that many but I count that as a quest to make the ultimate cheesecake. It's my favourite dessert. Yes, it's incredibly filling and calorie dense and expensive but I love it. The expensiveness factor is a big reason why I'm trying to perfect the art of the cheesecake.

On my first attempt back in high school, it tasted lke cream cheese on a graham cracker crust. Definitely not quality cheesecake material.

Since we're stingy on saving electricity, my next two attempts were of the no bake variety. They were good but they didn't taste like cheesecake at all. It tasted more like a heavy cream pie. But it was still delicious.

For Valentine's Day, I baked my first actual cheesecake. I followed a recipe on Reddit. It was a cheesecake but with a brownie bottom instead of the traditional graham cracker crust. I was a little stressed because I had bought less cream cheese than I needed and it seemed like it just spread over the brownie like a thin layer of icing. Also when I was cutting it, it was hard to pry it from the pan. I was worried the brownie had burnt but some parts of it weren't actually that cooked&#8230;

However, it was my closest attempt to an actual cheesecake I had ever made. It. Was. Delicious. When I got home from work, my brother and mom had almost eaten all of it.
