This morning I woke up at seven because I needed to buy batteries for my calculator. It turns out that I had a pack of new batteries in my room. Lol, awkward.

So, I got to school. Walked a bit with Shannon and Aiden. Circled the school a couple of times. Creeped on Ms Gratton and Ms Dunn (Ms Dunn was carrying Starbucks into her room with Mr Ottenbreit while singing happy birthday).

We walked past Brad's group. And he said "Edellllll". I find him so cute idk why. I also saw Kenneth (finger pointing shooting guy) like three times.

In spare I peacefully studied for physics.

During TA I had a good conversation with Brad. Idk why but HE'S SO CUTE. He's not even THAT good looking but aweh, he just melts my heart.

Here's our convo.

Brad: I love my hair today. My hairline is on the middle, so I can flip it anyway I want.
  
Me: Haha, that's cool.
  
-some small talk-
  
Brad: Is Shannon dating Aiden?
  
Me: Yeah. I find it a bit weird but whoever she likes, she'll date.
  
Brad: Mhm. Well, love works in mysterious ways. &#8211;_I found this so cute that I couldn't help but smile omg_&#8211;
  
Brad: Something's wrong with me, I can't have a relationship for more than two months and a half.
  
Me: Well, you're just in high school.
  
Brad: Still, I don't understand how some people can last 9 months or a year. I just last two and a half months.
  
Me: My first and only relationship lasted two and a half months. He was in grade twelve when I was I grade ten.
  
Brad: Was he in band?
  
Me: Yeah, he played tuba.
  
Brad: What was his name?
  
Me: Dylan.
  
Brad: Oh. I've heard storie about him.
  
Me: Like, druggie stories?
  
Brad: Yeah.
  
Me: It was so embarrassing. Everytime someone mentions it to me, I'm like no, shut up. It was such a mistake.
  
Brad: Did you go to post?
  
Me: Yeah but not post post, because he was there. He would have been drunk and I would have been like fuck you.
  
Brad: I see. Yeah, durin post post everyone was like drunk and stuff. Conrad was acting crazy and stuff. I was just taking care of everyone.

Math was interesting. We start a new unit. Whoo~ And our test was moved to Thursday because tomorrow is Friday schedule because of parent teacher interviews. Yay! More time to study.
