> [Last.fm](https://last.fm/user/edelgrace) is a website that can keep track of users and their listening habits. I've been listening to music with Last.fm since 2010 and am slightly obsessive over my music stats. These stats are for my listening from the past week.

**My week for October 5, 2018 to October 12, 2018**

### Top 10 Artists

It's no surprise that Coheed and Cambria has been pretty much all that I've been listening to. With their album *Vaxis I: The Unheavenly Creatures* coming out and seeing them live in concert, I've just been falling in love with them all over again. The other artists in my top ten I've been listening to a lot as well.

Erkan is a person I've met on Last.fm and he composes his own music. It's highly experimental and really intriguing. I do enjoy checking his works out. They're not very melodic and I put emphasis on experimental aspect. It's definitely something different.

### Top 10 Albums

Wow, who knew? Listening to Coheed and Cambria means that most of my top albums for this week is also Coheed and Cambria! I have been listening to *Vaxis I* on literal repeat. It is such a good album.

### Top 10 Songs

*The Gutter* just might be song of the year. I am in love with it. I am currently fighting the urge to not put it on right now. In fact, I asked one of my friends to recommend me some music because I just can't continue to listening Coheed and Cambria almost exclusively.
