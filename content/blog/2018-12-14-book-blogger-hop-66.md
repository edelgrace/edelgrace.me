Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week's question is&#8230;

> Do you listen to music while you are writing your blog posts? If so, what genre of music do you listen to?

Indeed I do! I could not begin to list the genres of music that I listen to. There are many and they are widespread. I wouldn't say I listen to everything. But I think almost every genre must have something that can appeal to many different people, regardless of their tastes. For example, everyone loves to hate on country. But I totally like listening to country Taylor Swift or some Martina McBride songs. In my city, there is a big stampede roadshow every year and country music plays around the city for like two weeks straight. I love it!

Another genre that people seem to not like is opera. I'm definitely not an avid fan but like, there are people out there who like Andrea Bocelli's "Time to Say Goodbye" and/or *Phantom of the Opera*! There's pretty accessible "opera."

But in general, I love my very wide genre of "rock." This extends to heavy metal, alternative, indie, prog, pop-rock, post-hardcore, emo, screamo, etc. I love all things rock! Maybe I just like how aggressive it is. I'm not sure why I love rock so much.
