I think I'm going through a Japanese band phase. I think it really started with the theme songs for _Gundam Seed Destiny_, then _Naruto_, then _Inu Yasha_, then _Bleach_, and then _Full Metal Alchemist_. FMA mostly. If it wasnt for FMA I would have NEVER heard of L'Arc~En~Ciel.

L'Arc~en~Ciel is my number one fave Japanese band and my number one fave song by them is Link (which is the opening theme song for the _FMA the Movie: The Conqueror of Shamballa_). I love watching Link live Anime Fest 2005 mostly because HYDE dances like a cute little girl and his voice isn't that bad live either.

I love anime! I've been watching it since I was three. It's so weird how much it influences me, all the shows and the episodes and the manga. I wonder when I'm going to outgrow it?
