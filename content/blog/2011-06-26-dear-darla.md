Right now, it's commercial break and I'm watching _The Little Rascals_. This movie is such a classic. I would always watch it nonstop when I was younger. It's almost kinda weird watching it now. I feel like a kid all over again! Except now, I can recite all the words to this movie.

My favourite lines?

_Dear Darla,
  
I hate your stinking guts.
  
You make me vomit.
  
You are scuuuum between my toes.
  
Love, Alfalfa_

That right there is the greatest love note of all history.

On a different note, I'm due to go to summer school next week. I'm only taking religion, so it only takes up half the time of normal summer school. All three levels of religion are required to graduate since I go to a Catholic school. Next year, I have no room for it because my schedule's all full. So, summer school.

I don't really know what I'm going to do after high school, so I'm taking all sciences and maths hence my full schedule. What if I finally decide what I want to do, but I don't have the required courses to take it in university or college? I guess better safe than sorry. But now I'm dreading my last year of high school. Fun stuff. Ah well, I'll make the best of it. For now, I have summer (after summer school) to look forward to.
