## The Concert

Last Saturday I went to go see Coheed and Cambria. I follow the band on Facebook and when I saw that they posted tour dates, I immediately went to look. I was seriously in disbelief that they were coming to Calgary. I don't know why I was so surprised, they've been to Calgary a couple times but I've missed every single one of them until now.

I bought the tickets super in advance, the day they come out back in June. I posted on social media asking if anyone liked Coheed and Cambria enough to go see them with me but no bites. The only people who responded were my friends from England and Australia. Of course. But since most of my friends are unemployed broke university students, I didn't feel like pestering any of them to go to a $50 concert with me.

Pro tip if you bought general admission and not VIP: don't go to the concert super early. I made that mistake. VIP/Gold/Platinum ticket holders were all lined up around two hours before the concert but they didn't start forming the regular line until around an hour before doors opened. I could have shelled out the extra money to see that one extra song and all the other perks but the concept seemed really ridiculous to me. Looking back on it now, maybe it would have been worth it. I loved Coheed and Cambria enough that I should have gave them more of my money.

Anyway, once I got in there, I immediately went for the merch table. I instantly got flashbacks to my first concert, which was My Chemical Romance at the very same venue. I bought a sweater that has *Unheavenly Creatures* on the back of it. I kinda wish I got a tour shirt instead but I was nervous at the last second and I didn't know how to say that so I just asked for the easiest thing: the sweater.

Since I went alone to the concert, I got there and tried to scope out the best place to stand. There wasn't a lot of people yet so I tried to get as close as possible. When I looked around, I found of my family friends! He was really surprised that I liked Coheed and Cambria. Somehow he was in shock that he had a cool "cousin."

So I talked to him and his girlfriend for a bit but then I saw one of my friends from university walk by. We parted ways. I was relieved I found one of my friends because I secretly wanted a mosh pit shield. He was good company anyway!

We talked for a long time. The doors opened at 18:30 but the first act didn't start until 19:30. It was a band from Onario, *Crown Lands*. They were pretty good! It was just a duo (I was instantly reminded of The White Stripes but their sound is completely different). The guitarist had the longest hair and beard I had ever seen. When he busted out his double necked guitar, he looked like a guitar Jesus.

The next act was *Protest the Hero*. I've heard a lot of praise for Protest the Hero from one of my friends. I've listened to a couple of their songs and I really like [Without Prejudice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8gulOH3i4s). Otherwise, I wouldn't say I'm a fan even though I recognize that they are pretty good.

They were pretty awesome and the vocalist was hilarious. In between songs he would tell stories about past concerts they played at Calgary. I think that's a really great way to connect to audiences. People like being remembered! Anyway, they were phenomenal. The band is pretty intense so there was mosh pits every single song. I was in a place right where the mosh pits kept forming and I did get pushed around a couple of times. Whoops.

Finally... Coheed and Cambria came out.

### The Setlist

* [The Dark Sentencer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3zm1_JSPOQ)

When I saw Claudio and his full head of hair, I freaked out. The fog machines were kicked up a notch and the lights were shining behind them like rock gods descending onto Earth. I will admit, since *The Dark Sentencer* is a rather new song, I didn't know it very well but it was amazing to hear.

* [Here We Are Juggernaut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLFtM4GIRA4)

This is another song that I'm not super familiar with but I had been listening to it a couple days prior to the concert and it was growing on me. I loved hearing the crowd sing along to the chorus. *So what? Here we are, juggernaut!*

* [Devil in Jersey City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwELa13rBo)

I really like this song! It was such a banger to listen to it live. I always mess up the chorus though when Claudio sings "Sayanora". I like this song because it's definitely a song I can dance to.

* [In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xj43rpDwnk)

It's a crime that I haven't listened to the album *In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3* until this week. There are a lot of good songs on this album. The title track is really good and pretty long, clocking in at eight minutes. Singing along to the chorus made me feel like I was marching into battle especially with my fist pumping into the air.

The guitar break near the end was absolutely legendary. I forgot that it was there in the song so when the chorus started up again I was caught off guard. But it was beautiful.

* [The Crowing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWnrVZ76k0g)

Unfortunately, I don't like *The Crowing* a whole lot. It's a good song but not really a song I would like to hear live. I prefer really pumped up songs for concerts and this one was a bit too mellow for me.

* [Blood Red Summer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFObU6-qN_k)

This is another one of those songs that started to grow on me. The chorus is super catchy. It's a bit mellow like *The Crowing* but has enough energy to keep it going. I messed up the chorus though. Since I'm not familiar with the lyrics, I kept saying "yeah" instead of "this" even though I knew it was "this." I was actually thinking about this exact thing before the concert. I knew I would do that, haha.

* [A Favor House Atlantic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnKP6HtmyNs)

*Good eye, sniper. Now I shoot, you run.* This song has a bunch of good lines. It was a real good feel song. I danced a bit to this song. There's no other way to do it. Even though I don't have much to say about this song, it's definitely my favourite.

Before the song started, they played an All Mother sound clip. My friend and I got excited because we thought they would play a song from *The Afterman* but it didn't end up happening. So while it was a disappointment, this song made up for it.

* [Ten Speed (Of God's Blood & Burial)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx5-5F2tGiQ)

When this song started, I literally yelled "Yes!" This is one of my favourite songs. I wish I was a lyric fanatic and then I would have sang along a lot more to this song. I feel sorry for the people who had to hear me mess up the lyrics to the song. *Ten Speed, if I must then I must* is a line I messed up a lot, haha!

* [The Suffering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnABRPS37hk)

This is a totally underrated song (underrated by me). I did like this song back then but I think this song will be a new favourite. I sang a lot to this song. *If it was up to me. I would have figured you out, way before the year clocked out.*

* [Here to Mars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svyLMR7yjhU)

Unfortunately, *The Color Before the Sun* is an album that fell off my radar. I only really liked *Here to Mars* from this album. So much that I've memorized this song. I also heard my friend beside me belt out the chorus every single time.

* [Wake Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avpcGH9Uim4)

Claudio introduced these songs as songs he wrote about/for his wife. I never really liked *Wake Up* too much (too cheesey for me) but it was touching and a good sing along sesh (somehow I memorized the lyrics without liking the song that much). So I was just swaying back and forth listening to Claudio crooning this song.

* [Island](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ED4GBcPI9s)

This song totally was not on my radar. I did not listen to *The Color Before the Sun* in depth and most of the singles other than *Here to Mars* didn't stick with me. I felt like a lot of people just stood there with their heads slightly bobbing to this song. There was one guy up in the front of me who was going crazy to this song.

* [Unheavenly Creatures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAjioxRA1bo)

AHHHHH. What a good "last song." Claudio gave up his guitar and just paraded around the stage with his mic. It was so weird seeing Claudio singing without a guitar in his hands. I freaked out during this song. It's just so good. It made me super hype for the album. *Oh pretty angel, swinging from your cable. I fear my dear, the end is near. So run, run, run, run, run, like a son of the gun.*

* [Welcome Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0H3RlaQVrM)

Is it an encore even if everyone knows you can't end a show without playing that number one signature song? When Claudio came back out, his hair was tied into a ponytail. Then he took out his double necked guitar and unleashed it. My friend was saying how he hoped Claudio would do it and he did.

There is absolutely no words for the performance for this song. It's literally their trademark song. Every single moment and beat was just pure getting lost in the sheer awesomeness of the song. My neck hurts solely because of this song because I was just head banging like crazy.

When it was over, I was in disbelief. I didn't want it to end. It was an hour of bliss and it ended just like that. Being able to groove out to the songs were great. I am a little peeved that they didn't play ***ANY*** songs from *The Afterman*, especially since that's my favourite album. That just means I will have to see them again and hope they play it!
