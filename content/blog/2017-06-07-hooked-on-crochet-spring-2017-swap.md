Hooked on Crochet is a Discord server that I am a part of. If you don't know what Discord is, it is essentially a chat client for gamers. You can create your own "servers" or chat rooms for dedicated topics. Hooked on Crochet is (obviously) a group of crocheters. They organized a yarn swap last spring which I took a part of.

My gifter got me a set of hand dyed Alpaca yarn, a llama stitch marker, and a pattern for a unicorn amigurumi! I really love the stitch marker, it's very cute and handy. The yarn I am planning to use for a shawl eventually, at least that is my plan for it. I will also eventually make a unicorn for one of my cousin's kids, while they're still young.

While I didn't get to take any pictures of the actual yarn I managed to get for my giftee, I did get a picture of the package that I eventually sent out. I also bought him a yarn swift from Amazon from a gift card that I had. What I ended up buying for him was otter stitch markers, a skein of yarn bought from Etsy, Caron Cakes, and some local yarn.

Overall, it was a great experience! I got some cool yarn out of it which was sweet. And I love the fact that my giftee was totally over the moon with what I got him. 10/10 would do again!
