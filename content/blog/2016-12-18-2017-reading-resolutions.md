This year I told myself I would read at least 25 books. It doesn't seem like a lot but when you consider my reading history the past couple of years, that's a big number.

  * **2015**: 7 books + 3 graphic novels = 10 books
  * **2014**: 19 books + 20 graphic novels = 39 books
  * **2013**: 40 books + 30 graphic novels = 74 books
  * **2012**: 18 books

As you can see, not great numbers. Each year I have been reading less and less. 2013 was a weird anomaly. So far this year of 2016 (there's still like ten days left in the year...) I only managed to read 38 books, not including graphic novels. In total I've read about 84 books. So that's still like 46 graphic novels that I've read. I really wanted my novel to graphic novel ratio to be greater than or equal to one. However, I still met my goal of 25 books. So kudos to me!

This year I decided to opt for minimalism and not sign up for any reading challenges. To me, the most important thing is going through my to read list. If I even manage to make a small dent in the list, I'll be happy.

**Here are my 2017 reading resoltuions:**

  * Read a total of 60 books.
  * Read at least 30 non-graphic novels.
  * Read more novels than graphic novels.
  * Don't take out any books from the library that are not in my to read list.
  * Read at least half of the books on my 25 books to read in 2017 list
