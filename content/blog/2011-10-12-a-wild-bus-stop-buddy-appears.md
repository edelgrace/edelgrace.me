This morning was confusing. There was supposed to be full band practice but most people thought it was only woodwinds and none of the brass came. Okay, trumpets came, a tuba, a baritone, and a trombone. Most of them were grade tens soooo. The flutes that were in my grade were mostly late. Yeah. It was a small group today.

We had to split up and half of us went into the choir room. Alyssa was looking up and when I looked up, I saw a very cool looking pyramid of Arizona cans. I counted over 15 of them. I actually think it was Rio's collection since he has an obsession with Arizona tea.

As for the actual music, we're learning Christmas music. Apparently the marching band has a Christmas parade next month so they're starting early. The Christmas songs are different. I don't really like them. _Angel Medley_ and _Santa Meets Sousa_ are the name. The Angel song is too repetitive and the Sousa song has confusing time changes.

During spare I took out a book in the library. _Rebel Angels_ by Libba Bray. It's the second book in a series. The first book is _A Great and Terrible Beauty_. The first book was okay but it's enough for me to want to read the first book.

Then in math we had a substitute because our teacher is away supervising a field trip out of province for the rest of the week. The sub doesn't have a math background so we were very confused until one of the math teachers who had a spare came in and taught it to us. I never had the math teacher before but a lot of people say nice things about her. I find her to be sweet and cute.

In physics, it was the same old same old antics. I really want a new class but all the other classes are full.

Lastly, in chemistry, we relearned stoichiometey. I love stoichiometey actually. It's so simple. Moles \* mole ratio \* convert. I have to help Alara with her chemistry tomorrow since she's in grade eleven chem and she's doing stoich right now. I love chemistry.

After school I had to take the bus with Marie. While we were sitting down and talking, this Filipino girl came over to us.

Her: Are you guys Pinoy?
  
Me: Yes.
  
Her: Cool. What bus are you waiting for?
  
Me: 79.
  
Marie: 39.
  
Me: I mean 39.
  
Her: Do you know where to stop at St. Matthew's?
  
Me: Yeah.
  
Her: Can you tell me when to get off?
  
Me: For sure.
  
Her: Thanks.

I expected her to leave for some reason. But no.

Her: My name's Kara. What's yours?
  
Me: Edel.
  
Marie: Marie.
  
Kara: Do you go to G school?
  
Me: Yeah. Do you go to G school?
  
Kara: Mhm. Do you know who I am?
  
Me: No.
  
Kara: Oh, okay.
  
Me: What grade are you in?
  
Kara: Grade ten.
  
Me: Cool. We're in grade twelve by the way.
  
Kara: Really? Do you guys know Kenneth?
  
Me: Who?
  
Kara: Omg you don't know? Spike hair, half blonde, half red. Sexy~
  
Me: I think I know who you're talking about.
  
Kara: Haha yeah.
  
Me: Do you know Reesha?
  
Kara: Mhm.
  
Me: Did she call you Kar bear? I heard her say it once.
  
Kara: I don't know, maybe. Sometimes people call me that.

Turns out this girl is somewhat Tumblr famous. Timothy (the short Timothy from YFC) once reblogged her nudes that some guy got ahold of. That must have sucked for her. It's weird because I saw the picture thinking she was from girl from the states but it turns out she goes to my school. Weird. Yeah. I don't know what side to take on this (btw I changed her name to respect her privacy but it seems like it's a little too late for that).

It's kinda her fault for taking those kind of pictures and sending them to some guy but the guy is just guilty. He posed as a 15 year old when he's actually 20. Yeah. Child pronography right there. Apparently she's not the only one being preyed on. It's disgusting. I've never heard of something like this before but wow. I can't believe some people. But, I tried not to judge this kid. But she kinda told me all of this way too easily.

That's not her only drama in her life either. It just seems like this girl needed someone to talk to. But doesn't she have friends or something? I don't know. I can't really judge without knowing all sides of the story which is impossible anyway. Which means that I will not judge.

Maybe I'll see her again tomorrow. I wonder what Shannon will think of her, haha. 

Oh, and I've been trying to keep in touch with some of my friends whom I've slightly drifted away from. I kinda miss those people. I'm going to work on friendships right now.
