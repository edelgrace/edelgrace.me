On Goodreads, my "want-to-own" shelf used to have 127 books in it. Now it has five.

Recently I've been bit by the konmari bug. I've konmari'd my wardrobe and my books so far. I'm still stuck on the books. I decided it would be fitting to prevent my book collection from growing back to it's ridiculous size and get rid of anything that doesn't spark joy on my book wish list.

### Books that made the cut

**The Last Unicorn by Peter S. Beagle**  
I read this book a couple of years ago. Although it's aimed at a younger audience, I really enjoyed this story. After reading it, I went to watch the animated movie as well. A small part of me has always been fascinated by unicorns and horses (I blame Sailor Moon as the source of that).

**The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde**  
To be honest, I don't remember much of this book but I do remember being in awe of Wilde's writing. I remember the last few pages more than anything. It was not exactly terrifying but it was a bit&#8230; Grotesque? I mostly want this book so I can re-read it.

**The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov**  
A couple of years ago I took a Russian Literature course and had to do a group presentation on this book. This book is probably one of the very few that I actually read front to back for a class. Actually, I read all the required books in this course. That was a first for me. Bulgakov's imagination is borderline execessive with this work but I do like his alternative history spin on Jesus' life.

**The Glass Menagerie by Tenesee Williams**  
Marie Kondo's motto is to get rid of anything that doesn't spark joy. This play is incredibly sad but in a way, it also sparks joy for me. I find it to be such a heartbreakingly simple story that I can't help but appreciate it.

**Sabriel by Garth Nix**  
When I was younger, I was totally absorbed in fantasy. I don't know what happened, I hardly ever read any of the fantasy genre anymore. Sabriel really touched something in me. I got sucked into the world. One of my childhood friends recently (as in, like a couple of weeks ago) told me that I reminded her of Sabriel. She was the one who recommended this book to me way back when. That's another thing that I appreciate about this book.

### Books that almost made the cut

**Paradise Kiss series by Ai Yazawa**  
Okay, I'm still on the fence about this one. I love this series and I love Ai Yazawa's work. Paradise Kiss is one of those series that sat with me for a while. Maybe I'll have to read this one over again and see how I feel about it. The reason why I'm not sure is because I feel like there's something unsettling about it. It's a little similar to how I feel about _The Glass Menagerie_. It's incredibly bittersweet. There are some scenes that I remember that actually make me feel a pang in my chest. I'm tearing up right now thinking about it!

**A Great and Terrible Beauty by Libba Bray**  
The Gemma Doyle series is pretty okay but damn, the covers are gorgeous (yes, I'm a little shallow). I love the gothic setting and historical aspect of it but unfortunately, it was lacking in content a little. It would be nice to have it sit on my shelf and look pretty but I would never pick it up and read it again.
