November went by super fast. I was taking a look at my to do list this morning and I saw that my "first of the the month" tasks were appearing. The beginning of November feels like just yesterday.

### Highlights

**I blocked Reddit from all my browsers** 

While I didn't successfully avoid Reddit altogether (I would check links that friends would send me or sit with my friends and looked at Reddit together), I managed to not browse Reddit *on my own*. Does that make much of a difference? To me it does! Usually I could spend hours upon hours on Reddit. I think I managed to curb that number last month.

**I made it past probation at my new job**

This month marked the third month I spent at my new job. It's been great so far. I do feel like I'm getting comfortable and getting to know people at work. I'm slowly feeling a little more confident.

**I saw pandas**

I went to the zoo with a friend and I saw pandas! They are adorable. We spent a great deal watching them eat. The way they eat is very interesting. They reminded me of the stereotypical fat middle-aged man coming home from work slouching on the courch and eating.

Other highlights were camels (they are so silly looking, we spent a good couple of minutes watching them standing around), monkeys (there was one Japanese macaque and it was screaming so loud and it sounded like a human), lions (the lion peed on the glass, it was great), penguins fighting (they kept screeching at each other and at one point it got physical).

## Statistics

I am a statistic *fiend*. I spend at most 5 minutes everyday (immediately when I wake up) to input the previous day's data. And most of the data is automatically generated so thankfully I don't have to worry about that.

A lot of up and downs this month. I've been enjoying the mild weather. I wonder what this means for December, though. I hope December won't be too chilly. Honestly, this November is like my ideal winter weather. Not too cold but just cold enough for it to snow.

Two major spikes this month. The first one, I think I was out with a friend to check out the opening of a new library. It is absolutely gorgeous. The other spike was our trip to the zoo. There was a lot of walking involved!

I am absolutely terrible with walking nowadays, especially on the weekend. It's getting colder and I opt to take the bus instead of walking to the station. It also means more reading time for me!

It does make sense that I'm walking less. The months that I walked the most this year was when I was unemployed and out of school. I had lots of free time to just go places and walk! It would be a stretch to say that socializing with friends make me more active but I do walk more when that happens.

The trend of a spike and then immediately trying to remediate the next day is prominent in this graph. Thing mid-late November got a little out of hand. I can't remember why. I might be that I was out and just kept checking my phone out of boredom.

In general though, I'm definitely making progress on spending less time on my phone. Two hours still seems like a lot of time, however. I might need to start breaking down what exactly it is that I do on my phone that takes two hours.

Tracked with [Sleep as Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep)

I seem to be solidly getting around 7 hours of sleep per night. I started going down to 6 hours of sleep because there are just not enough hours in the day to do the things I want to.

{{<figure src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dvozrk6m8/image/upload/v1543684160/Average_Hours_of_Sleep_gjbaqk.png" title="2018 Hours of Sleep">}}

In the grand scheme of things, I'm definitely sleeping more compared to the first half of the year. But I'm also sleeping less compared to the second half of the year. I'm trying to figure out the best number of hours of sleep for me. I would love for it to be 6 or 7 hours and not 8 hours.

{{<figure src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dvozrk6m8/image/upload/v1543684153/Top_20_Artists_phtjzl.png" title="Top 20 Artists">}}

For a monthly view, 10 artists is not enough. I definitely did listen to a lot of Coheed and Cambria last month (I'm listening to them right now). Not much on this list surprises me, expect for possibly **The Weeknd**. When did I listen to so much of the **The Weeknd**? I must have blanked it out.

Not a lot of surprises here either. I guess I didn't expect *Ascension* to be the top album. But I did expect all of the Coheed on here.

plenty's *あいという* makes sense to me. I definitely put it on repeat a couple times. *No World for Tomorrow* is a little unexpected. So is *Rich Girl*, and *Lollipop*. Spotify algorithm at it's best (worst).

### Books Read

* Mr. Darcy's Sister by C. Allyn Pierson
* [Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Woolf](http://edelgrace.me/blog/book-review-mrs-dalloway-by-virginia-woolf/)
* [168 Hours by Laura Vanderkam](http://edelgrace.me/blog/book-review-168-hours-by-laura-vanderkam/)

I didn't read as much as I hoped I would last month. I technically averaged a book a week though, so I guess that's fine. I also read a lot of manga this month. It will technically go to my read count but I don't know if I can really count it.
