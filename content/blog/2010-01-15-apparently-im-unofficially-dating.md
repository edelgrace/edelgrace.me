So yeah I'm kinda confused. The guy I like, I hang out with him a lot and stuff. We're constantly asked if we're dating. So on Wednesday he puts his arm around me and we're asked it again and he says, "Not officially..." I'm like what? Cause I've never heard anything about that.

And a couple of weeks before that I gave him his birthday present (he's 18 now. His birthday two days after mine.) He came home all happy and his mom got all angry and told him he couldn't get involved with me since he's an adult and I'm a minor. Sheesh. Parents.

So as I type on my iPod, I'm chatting with him. He hasn't said anything since then. About dating. I sure wish he did. Ughh. Anyway, I have finals to study for. See you~!
