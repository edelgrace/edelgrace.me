This was my second year going to my local con. Last year I went all three days but this year I just went one day. It was a lot of fun but also soooo exhausting!

It was typical weather for my city: snowing. Ugh. Gross. I got there earlier than I wanted, so I had to wait in line. In the snow. Thankfully, I wasn't waiting for too long! The line was so much faster than last year. Instead of walking around the building to the front entrance, they just let us in through the back doors. Less time waiting outside and less time spent walking outside is fine with me. The line itself was also a lot more organized. They split up the line into more lines instead of making arbitrary groups as the line moved. It was a lot more faster that way. Thank goodness!

<!--more Read the rest of my con shenanigans!-->

I went with two friends of mine and their friends. It was a lot of fun! My friend, P, dressed up as Petra from the anime _Shingeki no Kyojin_. She was the only one who cosplayed. She didn't get a lot of people asking for pictures and she actually enjoyed it that way. I think it's because not a lot of people who go to the con don't pay much attention to anime. But she looked super cool anyway!

We parted ways soon after, and Petra and I went (semi-window) shopping! For two hours. I mostly did the shopping, haha. But I also took a lot of pictures. There were a lot of awesome cosplays, and ahhh. They were all really awesome.

        Another Commander Shepard cosplayer. I had to chase down this guy and I called after him saying, "Exuse me, Commander Shepard!" and I felt a little bit like Emily Wong (a journalist in the game). It was surreal. Also it took forever for me to focus the camera and I giggled out of awkwardness (I should have explained myself, I hope he didn't think I was laughing at him...). That poor guy had to stand there for like a minute. Whoops.

P told me a lot about him before but she totally did not want to say anything to him at all, and she actually knows about him. He was totally cool and all my pictures of him turned out blurry. It looked in focus to me in the window thingy, I'm sorry.

        A Pyscho enemy character from Borderlands. This guy was cool. His eyes were glowing and everything. I think I saw him last year too, and maybe at Otafest at well. But dang, that detail. He looks like he basically stepped out of the game!

In the middle of the day, a friend and I went to get a photo op with the lovely Jessica Nigri, a cosplayer and Internet celebrity. She also does a voice in the RWBY animated series. She was super cute and super pretty! We got to get her to sign our photo with her, and her agent didn't let us pay for it. What an awesome dude. He was as upbeat and cool as she was! Probably one of the highlights of my day.

Also, in the picture, you can see that I'm all buddy buddy with Nigri but my friend is really far away from her. It's now a running joke that he and her are... Close. Haha.

After that, we wandered and shopped a little bit more. We ended the day with attempting to get into a panel but it was really packed so we didn't get in. Which was okay with me because I was about ready to pass out! And so we parted ways and went home.

Onto the merchandise... I spent exactly $100 dollars, including food and not including transit and coat check. My brother asked me to buy something Rooster Teeth (not happening as they are the only ones who sell their stuff and they're based in Texas so... Yeah...) or League of Legends. The only LoL thing I found was really basic messenger bags and they were like $40. Sorry brother, you aren't getting that... But I did end up buying him a Grunt POP! figure. My brother looooves the Krogans from Mass Effect and the Grunt figure was so adorable that I knew he'd love it! When we opened up the box, my brother immediately when "Aweeh, he's so cute." The figures are so tiny, he fit in my freakishly small hand! So. Cute. I really wanted to find a Garrus figure but was unable to do so. I think they're really popular because the Garrus figure is even cuter than the Grunt one, and because Garrus is like THE most loved character in Mass Effect.

I also bought some Homestuck merchandise. I debated getting a Scalemate plushie, but opted for the art instead. The calendar has been on my wish list ever since it came out. While I wasn't particularly found of the tarot cards, it was such a deal to get them. I don't regret it at all. I have a love for "predicting" things (I don't take it too seriously though) and with the gorgeous art and the cards, I think I'll have a lot of fun with them. I also kinda feel like Cardcaptor Sakura. I need to buy those (Clow Cards) next...

Lastly, there were a lot of cosplays that I wasn't able to take pictures of or didn't see. A moment of silence for these amazing cosplays: Sakura from Cardcaptor Sakura, Satsuki and Ryuko from Kill La Kill, my friend cosplaying Blake from RWBY, Ruby and Weiss from RWBY, dude wearing a "People Like Grapes" shirt, girl wearing a "Free Edgar 2014" sign, Kaworu and Shinji from Evangelion, countless Connors and Ezios and Edwards from Assassin's Creed, and Trickster Jane from Homestuck. I'm sure there are more but I just can't think of them at the moment. I also wanted to meet Westy from the Mikecast but it's pretty much impossible to randomly bump into a specific person who is not cosplaying.

I saw cool people and I bought cool things. Overall, it was a pretty rad day.
