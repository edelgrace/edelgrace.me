We finished watching WALL-E today! I think that was possibly the best Disney movie made within the past couple of years. Same thing with Up! of course. WALL-E was just too sweet. The love story was just too good to resist. I'm not going to lie, I teared up a bit at some parts (but I'm really emotional to being with). I kinda want to watch it again. I'll buy one day.

I went to the library immediately after school to print stuff out. My printer is really bad with ink and runs out pretty quickly. If I have to print out a lot (15 pages to be exact), I don't want to be wasting my ink. Thankfully, it only costed me less than $5 to print those pages out.

Just recently I got into Neopets again. I've been doing my dailies and selling some items. I do most of that on my iPod so I don't really play any of the games. No flash on iPods make me sad. Still, without the flash games, I'm finding that I win about 2k per day. I'm suprised. Back when I used to play, I barely made anything.

Now, excuse me while I go play Cheat.
