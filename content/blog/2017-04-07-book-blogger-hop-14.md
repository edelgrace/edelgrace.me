> If you could meet one author, dead or alive, who would it be? Submitted by Kristin @ [Lukten av Trykksverte][1]

I am in love with the BrontÃ« sisters. Their lives intrigue me a great deal and the sense of mystery surrounding them is too much for me to take at times. There are days when I spend hours researching and reading about their lives, despite most of the information being repeated.

It's hard for me to pick just one of the sisters but I just might have to choose Charlotte. I admire her works the most. Maybe it's because she published the most books out of her sisters that I prefer he works. That doesn't absolve the fact that I also would love to pick at her brain and learn about her life.

I'm not even sure what I would ask. I just would love to be in the prescence of an incredibly creative mind. She has led a romantic life that I almost envy. Yes, I envy tragically romantic lives such as hers.

But I think the day should be spent in her beloved moorlands. A picnic, if possible. We'd eat and drink while looking out on the desolate land. Maybe we'd talk about her childhood, the stories that she never managed to write, her sisters and her brother, or the regrets she has had in her life. Or maybe we'd just sit in silence and take in the view.
