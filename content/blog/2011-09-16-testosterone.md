This morning I had band practice. I enjoyed this band practice actually. We mostly just practiced Holiday and our "BGHS MARCHING GHOSTS" and "HUAH" yelling. It was honestly amusing. Tara and Conrad were singled out and it was hilarious. Conrad's voice was deep and manly while Tara's voice was rather girly and high pitched but louder than Conrad. I laughed.

In spare we watched half of the live version of Peter Pan. I loved it. But the bell rang right during the "I believe in faries, I do, I do!" part. We were all chanting and everything. It was disappointing. That's the only thing I hate about the shorter classes on Friday. Shorter spare!

Math was fun. Review time. Whoot. In physics, I don't know what we did in physics. Just random vectors shizsticks. It's rather boring so it slips out of my mind easily. In chemistry we did some more work on Hess' law. So far I'm loving and cherishing how school is easy.
