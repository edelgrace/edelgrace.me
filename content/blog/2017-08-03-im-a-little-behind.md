A couple of days ago I was behind on my granny squares for my temperature blanket. If you don't know, temperature blankets consist of one square a day and each square represents the temperature of that day. Thankfully, it's easy to catch up with temperature blankets! Even though I'm caught up with the squares, I still haven't woven the ends in yet nor have I joined them. Eek!

Last week I was babysitting my little cousin and he was playing with my yarn. He made a "bunny" and asked me to give it eyes and a nose. I tried my best with what I was given. I wasn't satisfied but my cousin was so impressed. I love how innocent he is.

Lately I've been thinking how fast he's growing up. He just recently turned 11 and he's already almost as tall as me! Now that he's older he's less receptive to my affections which is a little disheartening to me since he is still so cute and sweet!

If I never have kids, I'd think I'd be content with it because I am surrounded by kids in my extended family and I've already watched many of them grow up. We celebrated my cousin's birthday over the weekend. She just turned 19 and I still marvel over how it seemed like she was a small little girl just yesterday. The same goes for her brother. He's going into grade twelve this year and I just can't believe it. We went to a night market at our mall recently and my brother, cousin, and I just walked around by ourselves talking. It's amazing to me how he has grown into his own person. Of course, while we were there, we got to chow down on some delicious food. I got a burger at Bandit Burger and it was absolutely delicious.

The next day we went to the park to celebrate my cousin's birthday and we spent almost eight hours there. There was a lot of eating and we took a walk and just chatted together. We even took a nap under the tree from the food overload. It was pretty relaxing and I even sat by the water's edge to knit for a little bit.

One of my older cousins saw me knitting and asked if I could make her daughter a hat. I said yes! I'm a little nervous because I've never had anyone ask me to make anything before but I would love to make my second cousin a hat. My cousin's daughter requested that it be pink. I have no pink yarn! I guess I'll be shopping around for pink yarn soon.
