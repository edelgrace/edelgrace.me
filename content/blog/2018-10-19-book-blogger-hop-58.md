Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week's question is&#8230;

> If you were to dress up as a literary figure {author or character} for Halloween, who would it be?

Hmm... That's a good question. I would totally dress up as Anne Shirley from Anne of Green Gables. I don't think I could pull off the red hair though. It might be weird seeing an asian Anne but the Japanese really like Anne so it must have been done before, right? I just don't know how recognizable Anne would be. I might get mistaken for Pipi Longstocking or the Wendy's mascot. 

I think it would be super cool to dress up as any Austen or Bronte character. It's a little disheartening because those characters don't really have distinguishing physical characteristics that would make you go, "Oh, you're dressed up as Jane Eyre!" I do adore the 18th and 19th century fashion though and I think it would be a bunch of fun to dress up as someone from those times. I think if I were handing out the candy the kids would just see me dressed up as someone from a long time ago.
