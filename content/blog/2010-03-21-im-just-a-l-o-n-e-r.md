**Listening to:** You Rock My World &#8211; Michael Jackson
  
**Mood**: Accomplished, bored.

Ahh, I've been doing too much gaming lately. Even though I'm only about 20 hours in on Dissidia: Final Fantasy, I love it! Like Cloud always says, I **never** want the game to end! It takes a long time to finish the game anyway. There's so many things to do! Level-ing up, finding treasure, getting the best weapons, hidden bosses, unlockables... All of it just satisfies me! Sure, graphics are always good but I also love games with amazing plot and storylines! And characters you can relate to! Characters who you have no problem spending 55+ hours with. I may be FF obsessed. But there are others worse than me.

So this weekend has been very uneventful! I was supposed to go bowling yesterday but my parents didn't allow me to. Ah, oh well. Not to mention it's been a four day long weekend! Sheesh. I've done nothing. Except for my _LONER_ fanlisting. =]

Oh, I've been meaning to do a prompt!
