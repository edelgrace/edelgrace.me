This morning I had band. Shannon greeted me with an, "Voldemort might be dating my ex."

WHAT. Okay, Voldemort was this sexually confused/hungry, possessive, crazy chick Shannon used to date. Her recent ex tried to get Shannon to break up with Voldemort when Shannon and Voldemort were still daing. The ex hated Voldemorts guts. I think Voldemort is lying. She probably is because not only is she crazy, she's a liar too.

Spare was blah. Brad skipped, hung out in the bandroom, and I couldn't concentrate or anything. :/ On the plus side, I went to the library and checked out a book. _The Cellist of Sarajevo_. I tried reading it once at the public library but the due date was coming close and I couldn't renew it because I had to renew my library card.

Okay. I like Brad. But who does he like? Aweh he's so cute. I just can't take the cuteness. ASDFGHJKL. In TA, Brad was chatting away with me. When I notice a scar on his arm.

Me: You have a scar.
  
Brad: Yeah, I have a lot of them.
  
Me: Why do you have them?
  
Brad: Reasons.
  
Me: _\*suddenly clicks into my head\*_ Ah, I see.

Was Brad a cutter? But why? Brad's such a happy go lucky kid. Gahh. I am so confused. I wanted to throw a hug on him but that would be awkward, yes?

Whatever.

I fluked my math test. I just know it. Fuck.

In physics we did work but I was constantly feeling sick so I couldn't concentrate. Same thing with chemistry. By the time band practice came around, we were testing. Yuck. The chromatic scale. I hate the chromatic scale and I suck at it but somehow I got a 100% on it anyway. Okay, whatever. Fine by me.

Bus ride home with Shannon. Nothing new there.

Now I'm going to bed soon. Band practice in the morning. Blah. D:
