> **FO** means "finished object" in crochet and knitter terms. So any completed project is a finished object!

After making my [first granny square][1], I quickly made my second granny square. Both were made from Loop & Threads yarn of the wool variety. I can't remember the exact name of the yarn.

I am not quite sure about the colour choices but they were the colours I had on hand of the same yarn. It is better than my previous one in that it uses more than two colours. I have been crocheting for a couple of months now but I am still intimidated with colour changes. Eventually I want to work my way into making a really pretty piece with different colours that all fit together!
