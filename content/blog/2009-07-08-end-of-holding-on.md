Synopsis: Holding hands means a lot, but hands eventually slip away.

Your hand ever so reluctantly
  
slipped away from mine.

With nothing to hold,
  
my hand is empty.
  
Just a piece of flesh and bones.

My palm tingles even now.
  
A lasting imprint of your hand
  
-or more truthfully, a scar that blazes.

In just a few days, I had memorized
  
the map of your hand.

Every callous,
  
Every curve
  
Every crease,
  
Every criss and
  
Every cross.

Now I’m looking at the back window
  
of this suffocating van.

You’re smiling and laughing
  
as you walk away,
  
without my hand.

Nothing to cling on
  
but the burden of books.

Nothing to do but move on
  
to the distant fumes of chalk dust.

Nothing to see
  
but pages and pages of endless text.

Realize that books slip, that
  
chalk dust burns my nose,

and that my hands remain vacant,
  
until I feel the reawakening
  
of that blazing scar.
