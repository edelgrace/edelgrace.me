I went to visit another local yarn store called [Gina Brown's][1]. I was in the area waiting to meet up with some friends and decided to pop in and check the place out. It's way too convenient that this place is a ten minute walk away from a train station.

It's a nice store. In the back there's a big table available for classes and (I'm assuming) to just knit or crochet. There is a wide selection of yarn and I definitely did not take my time looking through all of them, even though I should have! Like I said in my previous yarn haul post, it would have been rude to visit and not buy anything! You gotta support the small businesses!

A couple of months ago I participated in a crochet along together using HiKoo Simplicity Yarn. I paid sooooo much more for these yarn buying them online. If only I knew they were sold for much cheaper in an actual physical store!

Oh well, I'm glad I grabbed these. And such pretty colours too!
