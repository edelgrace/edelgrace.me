I have been listening to "Gold" by Jeff & Casey Lee Williams nonstop all day. I just love it. It makes me want to dance around and sing. It also makes me feel very warm and fuzzy inside. It's been a while since I've listened to a song that makes me that gushy. I just can't get over the funky discos vibe. Those guitar licks and the strings and Casey's voice... It's seriously too much to love!

On another note, man, I'm already finding that writing a blog post everyday is hard. I don't have any topics! I guess I could do a reflection each day and record what happened explicitly. I've always loved reading diaries that recounted events. In fact, that's mostly what I've been defining a blog as: recounting my days.

This morning, I had to write a midterm in my Russian course. It was really brutal, I think. I wish I had studied a little bit more. I think I did okay but definitely not as good as I wanted. Fingers crossed that I passed!

For the next three hours (I have a three hour break between lectures) I worked on my thesis and outline on my Heart of a Dog paper. It was a painful three hours.

Then I had computer science lecture. I found myself falling asleep almost. I need more sleep. We learned more about GUIs and my mind just shut down. My TA walked over and told us that we didn't do so well on our last exercise. News I didn't want to hear. In the words of my fellow group member, "We have to step up our game for next time!" Ughh.

Bad news after bad news. I went to my ADS to go over my outline for a paper and I just complete missed the mark on everything. I'm really struggling with the assignment and I feel like I'm grasping at straws right now. I don't know how to read a book in order to do a literary critique. He said not to panic but I am totally panicking. He gave me a lot of good starting points but I still don't know where to go from there. Curse my mostly logical mind.

The bus route I take home stops at another university. Some people got on and it turns out two friends of high school got on as well! It was a pleasant surprise because I haven't seen anyone from outside of university in a very long time. Talking to someone on the bus for once was really nice. Ideally, I would have wanted to work on this blog post but it turns out that worked in my favour since I have more to talk about!

On the second bus home, I slipped on the wet floor and landed on my butt/black. My butt is slightly sore now and I scraped my elbow. It was embarrassing. Hopefully no one saw other than the bus driver. I like to sit near the front and don't look behind me to see if there are other people still on the bus.

By the time I got home, it was already way past dinner time. I ate and then it was already 8:30pm. Then my computer refused to turn on. So I just planned out my week and did some homework that I could do on my iPod. So much for no digital dependence tho semester. I swear I'll do better next time!

Now I'm listening to Hitomi no Junnin by L'Arc~en~Ciel and having major L'Arc~en~Ciel feels. I will go to bed as soon as I post this. Hopefully my thing will be ~500 words. There's no word count in the WordPress app. ;A;
