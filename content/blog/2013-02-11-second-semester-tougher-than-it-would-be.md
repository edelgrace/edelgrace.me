My New Year's resolutions aren't going so well. I'm pretty sure I've broken at least half of them already! But that doesn't mean I'm giving up on them. I'm starting fresh this week, and I will get stuff done.

This week is going to be tough. I have two midterms on subjects that I have absolutely no idea on what's going on. I didn't study as much as I wanted to on the weekend. I went to a 3 hour review session which helped a little bit and doing some homework assignments served as a nice review but still not enough.

Last night I had a weird existential mini-crisis. You know, the whole "omg what am I doing with my life I'm going to turn out to be a crazy old cat lady living in my parent's basement, that is, if I don't kill myself first" spiel. I spent an hour crying and dwelling on my feelings and I felt extremely better afterwards. The downside was that I spent an hour on this whereas I should have spent an hour doing my homework. So it's like 11:45 at night, my assignment's due in 14 minutes, and I still had two questions left to do. A Linkin Park song comes to mind. "I tried so hard, and I got so far. But in the end, it didn't even matter." Yeah I got through halfway of one of the questions and ran out of time. Let's just say that I took home a 39% with me that night.

So I'm taking this blog post to repeat my <del>vows, I mean,</del> resolutions that I need to work on.

## 1. Post more

The beginning on January was nice. I posted a lot then. Not so much for the rest of January.

## 3. Spend only an hour per week on Tumblr

I defs broke this resolution this weekend. But I'm giving up Tumblr for Lent (which starts this Wednesday) so it'll get better, and fast! I just need to queue about 60 more posts and I'm good for the next 40+ days.

## 5. Don't skip any lectures

I skipped one lecture. I'm a horrible person, I know. We had a guest lecturer (who just happened to be the Dean) and apparently it wasn't that helpful anyway for one of my classmates slept through it.

## 6. Stop doing assignments the day before

Why do all of my assignments have to be due on Sunday and/or Monday?? I leave everything to the weekend because I'm too busy doing nothing during the week.

## 12. 3.0 GPA for this semester

This isn't happening. I've failed a couple of quizzes here and there. But I'll try to get as high as I can.

EDIT: I just realized that my assignment is actually due tonight, not yesterday night. What a relief!
