I'm in a weird place where I'm reading a lot but I'm unsure if I'm feeling depressed because I'm reading too much or I'm reading too much because I'm feeling depressed.

I've always thought of books as an escape. That sounds a little too negative but I enjoy experiencing a story that I would probably never experience myself. Lately I've gravitated to historical fiction because it's just so different and unknown territory. But sometimes when I finish a book, I feel a little bit sad. Sometimes, I envy the characters for their exciting lives and feel worse about my own life.

At the same time, I read because my own life is boring. I'm not sure how to feel.
