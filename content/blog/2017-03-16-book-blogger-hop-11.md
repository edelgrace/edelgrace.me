Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week's question is&#8230;

> Do you read a lot of diverse or own voices books? Why or why not? Submitted by Kitty @ [Vicarious Bookworm][1]

Hmm&#8230; I'm not sure what this question means so I'm going to take a stab at it! Of course, I love a lot of variety with the different voices I read in books. It gets tiring reading about a smart intellectual and independent woman in the French Revolution the thirtieth time. I love exploring different characters from all walks life. Monotony is boring! I also love different types of books, both fiction and non-fiction, novels or graphic novels, etc.
