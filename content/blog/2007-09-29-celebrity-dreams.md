I had a dream, that Gerard Way and Amy Lee were at my church and they fighting over who was a better singer. It was so weird. Then suddenly, Gerard got naked. One second he had clothes, the next he didn't. He just magically got naked and strangely, Amy wasn't bothered with it.

I also had a dream that Billie Joe Armstrong murdered someone and got into jail and went all crazy up in the mind. He sat in a dark jail cell and started singing to himself. Extremely creepy! All my celebrity dreams are just too weird!
