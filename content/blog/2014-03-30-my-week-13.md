Man, this was the most productive week I've had since Reading Week! I'm super happy with my level of productivity. I got a lot done and I still managed to have a large amount of free time all to myself. On Tuesday, I got to hang out with a friend for two hours and I still got stuff done.

On Thursday, I went on a **Kill la Kill** marathon. My friends have been bugging me about watching it and since the finale was Thursday night, I spent the entire day catching up on the series. I had to watch about 14 episodes. As soon as I got home, I definitely just sat there and watched until around 11 at night. And it was okay, because in the morning, I was done everything I needed to do! I will say though, that the finale was pretty good. I was a bit disappointed because Kill la Kill was so hyped up but it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. My expectations for anime are too high. I just want another **Evangelion**! Needless to say, I'm looking forward to 3.33 in 2015. Please hurry up!
