On Monday I got asked out by Linquan. At least, I think so?? I woke up, browsed around on my iPod and then I checked my phone. Oh god. A text from Linquan. I had sent him a text last week and the first thing going through my mind was, "Am I finally getting a reply??" But no.

> Hi, how's going? Have you done your finals???

Okay, first off, his grammar. God damn, that is cute. Secondly, I feel like he's catching onto how I text. In other words, the multiple punctuation thing. Noooo. That's cute too but I liked it when you had your own texting style!! At first he was super informal, like, typing in lowercase and using texting shorthand and stuff. Then I started texting in full sentences and he immediately switched over to that. How weird that people adapt to each other so quickly...

Alright and then I was like "Yeah!" Keep in mind that this was the last day of finals. He MUST HAVE kept track or something, omg.

Nothing at all prepared me for his reply.

> Haha, good! Maybe we can have cups of coffee together some day

Hold up. WHAT? WHAAAAT?! Okay, once again, not really grammar but "cups of coffee." Cups. As in more than one?? That sounds dangerous, I can only handle so much caffeine.

Also, did he just ask me out??? On a date?? Did this just happen???? To be honest, I just grinned at my phone and stood up. Thank god I was the only one home because like whenever I'm nervous, I pace around the house (ESPECIALLY when I'm on the phone except in this case I was texting).

Of course, I said yeah.

Okay the only lame thing though was that when I asked where he was like "It's up to you." Ummmm. Okay?? I JUST started drinking coffee last month and I don't really know any good coffee shops. So I said the first one that came to mind. The Starbucks near Sunnyside Station.

And then I immediately regretted it because I remembered that there are SO MANY other cute independent coffee shops in the area and I said **Starbucks**. Much regret.

I've only been to that Starbucks like twice. Mostly because my friends love going to Muku (a Japanese restaurant in the area) and we like to meet up in the Starbucks. It's really nice though! It's kinda small and cramped but I think it's super cute.

Okay, anyway, I had to reschedule because my mom cancelled our trip and made it on the date we were originally going to go on. That was such a hassle and I was so embarrassed omg.

Also, I told my friend Kiran about all of this. She's so excited and enthusiastic and optimistic about it... More so than me. I'm actually dreading this so much. I'm so nervous! I'm afraid it will be a disaster. Whenever I go to talk to Linquan, I get so nervous. My face turns super red and my palms get sweaty.

Okay but ever since I started having feelings for this guy, I've been trying to rationalize my way out of it. To like, get rid of my feelings. This has been going on for months and I almost believe myself at this point. I sent Kiran an email about this and I'll try my best to reproduce this from memory.

  * **But he was my TA**  
    Is this even allowed??? This can't be. He was in a position of authority over me. He could very well be in a position of authority over me again (as in, he could be in charge of my grades). This has to be looked down upon in the graduate realm. I don't want his reputation ruined! Even if I'm just flirting with him, that could potentially jeopardize his position.
  * **Sorry, could you repeat that??**  
    Language barrier. This is so embarrassing omg. I feel so bad when I have to ask him to repeat what he said over and over again. But I guess at the same time, it's a plus because I have to listen extra hard to what he says and I am usually such a bad listener omg.
  * **You have to be, like, 25 (please be 25)**  
    He's like 27 (probably turned 28 by now) and I'm not even 20 yet!!! I get the vibe that he's super mature. And I have the maturity of a fetus. The age gap is really... Big... Also I feel like that since he's "so old", he HAS to be looking for wife material and NOT a casual let's date for the heck of it fling. Where is that picture on Tumblr, when I need it?? "Will you marry me?" "I don't even know how to make rice."
  * **Oh it's just a Filipino/Canadian thing (or, that's something we say on the Internet)**  
    Cultural barrier. He was born and raised in China. I am Filipino but born and raised in Canada. That's three different cultures at play here. I guess we could throw in Tumblr culture to make that four. Can we really relate to each other??? Can I get along with someone who has probably not experienced the beauty of the Mass Effect trilogy???
  * **I kinda hate myself**  
    I'm still trying to wrap my head around why Linquan suddenly sprung this on me. I don't understand at all. There are so many cute Chinese girls. I am neither cute nor am I Chinese.

Actually, the text I sent last week kinda implied a meeting. And in that meeting I was planning to do the thing. The thing where I would be like "we're just friends, right??? Can we keep it that way??" That would have been an act of self deprecation. That was my plan. Good thing it didn't go through.

But I'm still super nervous. Ugh.
