<a rel="_nofollow" href="http://www.coffeeaddictedwriter.com/p/blog-page.html"><br /> </a><a rel="_nofollow" href="http://www.coffeeaddictedwriter.com/p/blog-page.html">Book Blogger Hop</a> is a weekly meme run by Coffee Addicted Writer. Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week's question is&#8230;

> Can you say this about yourself? Nothing makes me happier than sitting down with a good book.

Not even close.

Some things that make as happy or happier:

* Eating really good food
* Having a meaningful conversation with a friend
* Sitting in the field in my father's homeland looking up a starry sky
* Listening to a good song in the window seat of a train watching the city pass by
* Playing a video game and being absorbed in a virtual world
* Falling asleep to the sound of rain
* Singing along to my favourite songs
* Watching a good TV series that can make me sob
* Walking along the river on a sunny day
* Going to a concert
* Playing with really cute babies
* Dog spotting around the city
* Etc.

The list goes on and on. Sitting down with a good book is definitely on that list but it's not the only thing.
