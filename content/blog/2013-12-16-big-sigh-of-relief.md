I was freaking out because lol I look like shit and I'm unprepared for this exam and I didn't want senpai to witness all of this. It was a biiiig relief to know that he wasn't there. I could write my exam in peace and not worry about looking like an idiot in front of him! Downside is that I wished I saw him at least one more time before the new year. :( I need to figure out when Chinese New Year is next year I'll have to give him his chocolates then. :) He's so cute. :(
