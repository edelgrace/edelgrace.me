Why are there so many songs about Friday? It's a great day but I don't want to hear people sing "Friday" and "Last Friday Night" off key all day.

Anyway, Fridays are usually those days that you just want to fast forward through.

In band, we got a talk from Mr. Reigel. The whole, "you're private life does affect the team" talk. He talked a bit about drugs and alchohol and such. I couldn't help but think, "Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad" in my head while he was talking about it. Yeah. I guess I'm not exactly part of the team as I'm not in marching band but I guess you can say I'm... A guest team member? I don't even know.

Math was boring as always. But it was good bonding time with Mike and Dylan. I enjoy those two. &#8216;Tis never a dull moment.

Physics. Can I please just yell at the whole class to shut up and behave without feeling bad and embarrased?

Chemistry was more stoichiometry review. I was in weekend mode the whole period.

Weekends for me a rather boring though. It mostly consists of studying, homework, fooling around on the Internet, or doing something with my family (and in that order too). This weekend I have to study quite a bit. I have three unit tests next week. And all one after the other. It's kinda stressful, but I'm sure I'll do well... Hopefully, anyway.
