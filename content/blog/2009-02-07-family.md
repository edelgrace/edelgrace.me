It feels good to be writing again. I haven't written anything in a while. It feels good. ^_^

I feel nalgostic though.

I miss the Philippines. I miss their smiles, their hugs, their laughs, their hands, everything. 

I want the heat, the sun, the blue sky, the blanket of stars at night.

The people treated me so differently there. There, random guys from the street tell me I'm hot. People smile and want to talk to me. People tell me I'm pretty. People WANT to talk to me. If they think I'm quiet, they want me to talk, and they actually try to get me talking. 

Here (at my school) no one really listens nor cares about wait I say. They fuss about how I don't talk at all, but they do nothing about it. No one asks me if I'm okay. No one hugs me. No one smiles and tries to talk to me.

\*sigh\*

When I really think about it, the only thing I missed about Canada was clean washrooms.
  
That was it. Not even my friends. I didn't think about my friends at all when I was there.

I hope next year, when I go to Grandin I'll make new and better friends >.> 

But what I liked and miss the most about the Philippines was that I truly tasted what having real friends was like.
