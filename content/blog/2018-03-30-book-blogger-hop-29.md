<a rel="_nofollow" href="http://www.coffeeaddictedwriter.com/p/blog-page.html"><br /> </a><a rel="_nofollow" href="http://www.coffeeaddictedwriter.com/p/blog-page.html">Book Blogger Hop</a> is a weekly meme run by Coffee Addicted Writer. Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week's question is&#8230;

> How many book clubs do you belong to? If you do belong to an inperson book club, do you have meetings in the day or evening? Do you meet at someone's house or meet at a local restaurant or coffee house?

I don't belong to any book club. I have entertained the idea of book clubs but I don't like the pressure of having to read a book quickly. I'm a fast reader to begin with but I like to read things on my own pace. I am also very introverted so the idea of group discussions is a little bit overwhelming for me. I think I would be the person who would just sit and listen for a couple of months before I'm ready to start delving into conversations.
