### Day 19: Total Body

I got home today after writing a midterm and I was so tired that I was tempted to just not do the workout today but then I realized tomorrow os rest day and who wants to work out on rest day? Not me. So I decided against it and got off my butt to do it. And I'm glad I did because today was so much easier!

### Video 1: Butt Lift and Slim Thighs

I did this workout yesterday because I was bored and yay I get to do it again! This is a very easy video but the burn is definitely there.

  * _Straight Leg Pulse:_ By far the easiest move. Cassey doesn't keep you going long enough for it to hurt.
  * _Fire Hydrant and Fire Hydrant Kick:_ These definitely got tiresome especially when the kick was added but the burn felt amazing.
  * _Sexy Dancer Kicks:_ A very simple move. You really have to focus on tending your legs and moving slowly and deliberately to feel something.
  * _Hot Potato:_ Another easy move to do and to feel the burn. I struggled with the pacing a bit because I didn't want to tap on the floor too loud and wake my parents up.

### Video 2: Fat Destroyer

My heart was really pumping for this video! At the risk of repeating myself, this is hard to do quietly.

  * _Squat Tap:_ I didn't do the jump associated with this but I did make sure to squat as low as possible.
  * _Lunge to High Kick:_ I lost my balance easily with this one, haha!
  * _Plank Walk Opener:_ A fun move that kind of slowed down the pace but not too much.
  * _Plank Jack:_ Had to substitute this one with a quieter version but even that was difficult.
  * _Mountain Climber and Wide Mountain Climber:_ The wide climber was LOUD but I managed to do the normal version well.
  * _Pile Hops:_ Another one I couldn't do with the jump, I just focused on squatting as low as possible.

### Video 3: Upper Back and Leg Stretches

Really great stretches for the legs, my problem area. It requires the usage of a belt or a long strap. You really get a stretch out of this one!
