**My week for November 16, 2018 to November 23, 2018**

### Top 10 Artists

{{<figure src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dvozrk6m8/image/upload/v1543121488/top_10_artists_x41doj.png" title="Top 10 Artists">}}

1. **Coheed and Cambria** (+1)
Coheed and Cambria was only dethroned for a week! I wouldn't say I listened to *a lot* more Coheed. The number is nice and low so hopefully it means I listened to more different artists this week instead of repeating this over and over.

2. **My Chemical Romance** (+1)

3. **Björk** (+2)

4. **宇多田ヒカル** (+2)

5. **L'Arc~en~Ciel** (-5)

6. **Horizon** (+)
Horizon is a YouTuber who covered a lot of Japanese songs and interpreted *Homestuck* songs. She has one single original song and it's pretty good. Recently she liked a comment of mine, I hope it means she's back to recording music because she hasn't posted in years!

7. **The Strokes** (+)

8. **Evanescence** (+)
This seemed totally out of the blue but I did noticed a lot of Evanescence coming up on shuffle. Spotify algorithm, what are you trying to tell me?

9. **Jeff Wiliams** (+)

10. **Alexisonfire** (-1)

### Top 10 Albums

{{<figure src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dvozrk6m8/image/upload/v1543121487/top_10_albums_t58qqm.png" title="Top 10 Albums">}}

1. **Björk — Post** (+8)
What a jump! I really love *Post*. There are a lot of good songs off this album.

2. **My Chemical Romance — Danger Days** (+)
I suspect Spotify algorithm is the culprit but I'm not complaining.

3. **My Chemical Romance — The Black Parade** (-)

4. **宇多田ヒカル — ULTRA BLUE** (+)
I listened to this album straight through and wow, I don't know if there's a single song I don't like on this album. But there aren't a lot of *amazing* songs on this album either. It's still good!

5. **Jeff Williams — RWBY Volume 1** (+)

6. **Mashrou' Leila — Ibn El Leil** (+)

7. **Alexisonfire — Crisis** (+1)

8. **Coheed and Cambria — The Unheavenly Creatures** (+)

9. **Evanescence — Fallen** (+)
*HOW?!* I don't even like that many songs from this album.

10. **The Strokes — Is This It** (+)
The classic early 00's rock album. I really liked this era of music.

### Top 10 Songs

1. **boy pablo — everytime** (-)
Damn, boy pablo is doing good. This is the second week in a row. To be fair, this is a good song!

2. **My Chemical Romance — SING** (+4)

3. **宇多田ヒカル — time will tell** (-1)

4. **horizon — Lost and Found** (+)
*I'm not a wreck but I'm far from fully healed.*

*I can't express the weight of the silence/But when it's filled with your breath/I seem to fear it less.*

Ahhh this is why I love musicians who write their own song lyrics and are good at it. Even though horizon is not a professional, there is something so incredibly beautiful and genuine about this song. It seems almost a little too personal. But it's so heartfelt.

5. **Björk — All is Full of Love** (+)


7. **Coheed and Cambria — No World for Tomorrow** (+)


8. **Coheed and Cambria — Old Flames** (+)


9. **Zessei Bijin! — I'm Your Man** (+)
Zessei Bijin is a YouTube singing group who covers Japanese songs. They covered *I'm Your Man* which is actually a Korean song by 2PM. There's just something so great about an all girl group singing "I'm your man" over and over again.

10. **Alexisonfire — Keep it On Wax** (+)
