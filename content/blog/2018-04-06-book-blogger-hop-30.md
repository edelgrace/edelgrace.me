Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week's question is&#8230;

> Do you overextend yourself with too many reviews because you can't pass up a book in hopes you will get them all done or do you carefully plan and be sure you can fulfill the deadlines for all the promised reviews?

I usually read one book at a time. That being said, I don't read books solely just to review them. I did attempt to do that a couple of times. Maybe I'll go back to it one day. I like to read books at my own pace and I don't want to be stressed out trying to read a book before a deadline and coming up with a comprehensive review to boot. Maybe now that I'm in an in-between stage in my life I would go back to that.
