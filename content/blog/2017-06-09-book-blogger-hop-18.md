Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week's question is&#8230;

> If you could have lunch with any living authors and/or book bloggers, who would you choose and why?

Oh man, the living restriction is a tough one. If language wasn't a barrier, I would definitely have lunch with Haruki Murakami. Although I have mixed feelings on his work, I feel like it would be pretty nice to sit down with him and chat over a cup of tea overlooking Tokyo (I'm assuming he lives in Tokyo) in some little cafe. I'd probably just let him talk about his views on life, his running, his portrayal of women in his novels, and so on.

If language is a barrier, I just might have to sit down and have a chat with Lucy Kinsley. If you are unfamiliar with Lucy, she is an artist with a couple of graphic novels under her belt. I will admit I have a little admiration crush on Lucy. She seems like a fun-loving quirky woman and she would probably know the best hidden place to have lunch at.
