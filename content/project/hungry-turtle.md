# The "Problem"

The goal of this project was to design a button that would delight its user and respect some aspects of their personality. In this case, the user was a fellow classmate of mine. After some interviewing, I determined the following:

* She watches a lot of movies but  no horror or rom coms please
* She has a double major in psychology and lingusitics
* She wants a pet box turtle and a cat named Aang (like from *Avatar: The Last Airbender*)
* She works a lot and enjoys it (just wishes she would get paid more)
* She listens to a lot of podcasts some which are movie related and some are DnD related (but she's never played DnD before)
* She likes the X-men!

# The Process

## Sketching

The first instruction was to come up with ten sketches of different buttons. They did not have to be perfect or even feasible, just ideas.

After that round of sketches I came up with a couple of more after reflecting on it.

## First Prototype

What I came up with was a virtual terrarium featuring *Kowther's Turtle*. One thing I noticed about Kowther was that she has an apetite for learning things. I thought it would be a fun idea to have a button to feed a turtle in order for it to play movie trailers of movies that she would might like to watch. Depending on the food given, it would learn to play movies from certain genres more or less.

{{<figure src="/img/project/kowthers-turtle-button/prototype-04.png" title="After watching the trailer, the user can feed a strawberry to tell the turtle they did not like the trailer (red = BAD)">}}

{{<figure src="/img/project/kowthers-turtle-button/prototype-06.png" title="Or the user can feed the turtle a piece of broccoli to indicate they liked the trailer (green = GOOD)">}}

## Feedback/More Sketching

Some of the feedback I received:

* Would need some instructions
* Would need a way to cancel a trailer
* Clarification on the purpose of the green and red foods and how it affects the interaction

{{<figure src="/img/project/kowthers-turtle-button/sketch-13.png" title="Simple instruction overlay">}}

After discussions with other classmates, I realized that my button relies a lot on third party content and it doesn't let other aspects of Kowther's personality shine. I decided to let the food trigger other actions than just movie trailers.
