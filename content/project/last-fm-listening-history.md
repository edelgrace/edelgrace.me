## Introduction

I have keeping a record the songs that I've listened to for seven years as of February 2018. The way I've done this has been through [Last.fm](https://last.fm) by a process called scrobbling.
 
## Which songs are the most similar? The most dissimilar? 



## What different themes are associated with the songs I listen to the most?


## How different are my listening habits before and after I started using Spotify?


## Are there any periods when I listen to songs more often?

The following are graphs that showcase when I listen to songs the most often.

### Yearly

It seems that as the years go on, I've been listening to less and less music. In the year 2011-2012, I was in high school. I think this was the peak of my music listening because I associated music with my identity quite a lot back then. Also, since I was still new to using Last.fm, I was more enthusiastic about recording songs. One hypothesis that I have as to why 2015 onwards is quite a difference to previous years is that midway through 2015, I got into a relationship. A lot of my free time was now spent hanging out with my boyfriend.

### Monthly

Across all years, this is how many songs I listen to per month. February has a significantly less scrobbles, probably due to the fact that February is a shorter month. However, it's only a couple days shorter than other months so it wouldn't account that much for it.

June, July, and August are months where I spend a lot of time out of the house and not a lot of time listening to music. September might be so high because of the new semester. The November and December dips a bit possibly because of the end of the semester and holidays.

## Are there any factors that can predict high play counts? Low play counts?


## What’s a better way to calculate a “top artist?”

According to Last.fm, these are my top artists:

The way Last.fm calculates a top artist is simply by how many times you have listened to an artist. I know that for me, I tend to go through a lot of phases so my top artists are not accurate. I could listen to an artist 500 times and then never listen to them again. This metric doesn't accurately reflect what a top artist to me.

The way I see a top artist is a combination of three factors:

* How consistently I listen to an artist 
* How many different songs I listen to by an artist out of their entire discography
* How long they have been in my library for

In my opinion, here are 10 artists that I feel would by my top artists, purely just from how much I like the artists. These artists are musicians that I would not hesitate to say they are one of my favourites.

* L'Arc~en~Ciel
* DIR EN GREY
* Bjork
* Utada Hikaru
* Joanna Newsom
* Marina & the Diamonds
* Thrice
* My Chemical Romance
* Green Day
* Mashrou' Leila
