## Introduction

I have keeping a record the songs that I've listened to for seven years as of February 2018. The way I've done this has been through [Last.fm](https://last.fm) by a process called scrobbling.
 
## Which songs are the most similar? The most dissimilar? 



## What different themes are associated with the songs I listen to the most?

## How different are my listening habits before and after I started using Spotify?

## Are there any periods when I listen to songs more often?

## Are there any factors that can predict high play counts? Low play counts?

## What’s a better way to calculate a “top artist?”

According to Last.fm, these are my top artists:



The way Last.fm calculates a top artist is simply by how many times you have listened to an artist. I know that for me, I tend to go through a lot of phases so my top artists are not accurate. I could listen to an artist 500 times and then never listen to them again. This metric doesn't accurately reflect what a top artist to me.

The way I see a top artist is a combination of three factors:

* How consistently I listen to an artist 
* How many different songs I listen to by an artist out of their entire discography
* How long they have been in my library for

In my opinion, here are 10 artists that I feel would by my top artists, purely just from how much I like the artists. These artists are musicians that I would not hesitate to say they are one of my favourites.

* L'Arc~en~Ciel
* DIR EN GREY
* Bjork
* Utada Hikaru
* Joanna Newsom
* Marina & the Diamonds
* Thrice
* My Chemical Romance
* Green Day
* Mashrou' Leila
