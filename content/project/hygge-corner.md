# The "Problem"

> **hygge, n.** a quality of cosiness and comfortable conviviality that engenders a feeling of contentment or wellbeing (regarded as a defining characteristic of Danish culture)

Hygge can mean different things to different people. My interpretation of hygge is a more social take. To me, hygge is sharing special memories with the people you love in a space that is safe, comfortable, and welcoming. Generally, hygge is technology free, but sometimes the digital world can be the bridge across borders and timezones and offer a space that can be cheaply customized to your own hygge needs.

# The Solution

{{<youtube 317NmLQjfcU>}}

This program allows users to customize their own space and fill it with memories of their choosing in the form of photos or videos. The space itself is a pillow fort that emphasizes a casual coziness and allows the user to feel a little more at home. Users can designate different furniture pieces as their friendship blanket, family chair, and drawing pillow. Each piece has photos associated related to its central theme and can be customizable in the form of drawing.

This space can then be shared with others and used as a channel of communication where all users can slow down and reminisc or learn about each other.

## Is this hygge?

To me, this incorporates the two most important aspects of hygge:

### Comfortability

The space itself is designed to feel warm and familiar. The log cabin setting gives a sense of a wintry night where you need to huddle by the fire and the pillow fort is an enclosed space that encourages the feeling of huddling together. The lighting is dim and the white noise in the background does not make the space feel empty and fills the room.

Even the photos and videos evoke some comfortability as they represent precious memories that are meant to please the heart and not cause others discomfort.

### Low pressure social interaction

Even for the most introverted, this program enables users to choose who they want to share their space with and when. Even though there are objects in the space that may provide as talking points, the users don't have to feel obligated to use them as such and may opt for some casual conversation instead. This way, it remains an intimate setting for all.

# The Process

My initial sketches were incredibly in the vein of stereotypical commercialized hygge. They were also geared to solo experiences rather than an experience that can be shared.

## Feedback/More Sketching

After some feedback, I wanted to incorporate more of the social aspect and focused on collaboration and party games.

Interestingly enough, I was drawn to one of my initial ideas of a pillow fort from TODO this article. After some more feedback, I wanted to combine the collaboration aspect with the pillow fort building. Due to technical limitations, the final idea was a solo experience of building the fort that resulted in a space that could be shared.
